<h2>EXACT METHODS IN SOCIOLOGY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By FRANKLIN H. GIDDINGS, Ph. D.</span>,</p>

<p>Those who do pioneer work in science encounter not only
the inherent difficulties of research and interpretation, but
also the misapprehension of certain educated men whose distinctive
gift is a fatal genius for applying false standards of measurement
to the progress of thought. Seizing upon some branch of
knowledge that is in a state of vigorous development, when its
newer results are out of harmony with its earlier hypotheses, such
critics love to point out these contradictions, and try to prove that
the branch in question is no science at all, and that its teachers
are hardly worthy of respectful consideration.</p>

<p>The history of science contains many interesting chapters pertaining
to this kind of criticism and the fate that has invariably
overtaken it. When Copernicus and Galileo showed the absurdity
of the Ptolemaic astronomy, the theologians enjoyed themselves
for a time, as they demonstrated&mdash;to their own entire satisfaction&mdash;the
folly of all rationalistic attempts to explain what revelation
only could make clear. When Darwin explained the origin of
species through variation and natural selection, the pretensions of
biology were completely exploded by its lay and clerical critics
(they thought and said so) by the extremely simple device of the
"deadly parallel column." Was not Cuvier a great anatomist,
and had he ever taught this nonsense about the mutability of species?
Was not Agassiz the most learned naturalist alive, and what
had he to say about Darwinian vagaries? Had he not proved,
over and over again, that the very concept of the species was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
notion of a group of characteristics that could not possibly change
or be changed from generation to generation? In more recent
years we have again seen the same method of reducing science
to a variety show for the entertainment of the tired general reader
applied to both biology and psychology. Weismann has tried to
prove that acquired characteristics are not transmitted in heredity,
and that the germ plasm is distinct from the somatic cells. The
neo-Lamarckians, Spencer, Cope, and some of the botanists have
contended for the older interpretation. Is biology, then, a science?
Forbid the thought! Heaven preserve our minds from
such confusion!</p>

<p>If the sociologists have hoped that they alone might not be
overtaken by easy annihilation, they deserve to be humiliated.
But it is safe to say that they have cherished no such illusions.
If the men who have devoted much time to the scientific explanation
of society have had no other qualification for their task, they
have at least shown some acquaintance with the history of thought.
And so it is not likely that they have suffered deeply from disenchantment
when they have been confronted with the regulation
exposure of "the present position" of their science.</p>

<p>There is no need of wasting space to prove that the kind of
criticism here referred to is without scientific value. The present
position of any science can not be determined by arraying its contradictions
and inconsistencies, irrespective of a serious attempt to
ascertain which of its concepts and hypotheses have inherent vitality.
It is precisely when a science is at its best, surely advancing
year by year and full of promise for the future, that contradictions
most abound in its monographs and text-books.</p>

<p>A true scientific criticism, then, must proceed by a different
method. The present position of a science can be ascertained only
by instituting three specific inquiries, namely: First, among the
more or less contradictory conceptions and hypotheses which constitute
its groundwork, what ones are surely displacing all others
and gaining the wider acceptance among active students? Second,
what progress is being made in the application of exact methods
to research? Third, is there a practical or working harmony between
the concepts that are gaining ground and the more exact
methods of research that are being perfected? Do the concepts
and hypotheses lend themselves to exact methods, and do they, on
the whole, help to perfect methods? Do improving methods, on
the whole, confirm or strengthen the concepts that are gaining
wider acceptance?</p>

<p>If these inquiries are applied in the domain of sociology they
bring to light unmistakable evidence of a steady and gratifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
progress toward scientific consistency and rigor of method. Much
babble about social ills and possible reforms still masquerades as
social science. A great deal of loose thinking and slipshod investigation
is paraded as expert opinion on questions of social welfare.
But no one who has seriously followed the efforts of scientifically
trained minds to discover the natural laws of social evolution
is in any danger of confounding the results thus far
obtained with the chatter over every passing fad. In the more
serious work itself there is found a vigorous and hopeful disagreement
of opinion upon all unsettled questions. But the fact of real
significance is that the disputation has become intensive. The
debate no longer ranges over a wide field. A selective process
has eliminated one after another the more loose and vague conceptions
of the science, the irrelevant issues, and the superficial
analogies. There has been a progressive concentration of attention
upon a group of closely related and fundamental problems.</p>

<p>The sociology of August Comte was little more than a highly
intelligent and quickening talk about social order and progress.
It convinced thoughtful men that there is a social order to be
studied in a scientific spirit and by scientific methods, and that
social progress conforms to laws that may be discovered. Mr.
Spencer narrowed the field of sociological inquiry and gave precision
of statement to all social problems by bringing them within
the formulas of universal evolution. He still further narrowed
the field by demonstrating the close relationship of social phenomena
to the phenomena of organic evolution and by seizing upon
certain psychological facts as chief factors in social causation. All
fruitful later work in social interpretation has been a further concentration
of investigation upon the psychic factors. While admitting
that social as well as mental phenomena are subsumed
under biological phenomena, and that the parallelism of social
organization to biotic organization is real, the younger students
of sociology have developed the science as an offshoot of psychology,
and have dropped the biological analogy as unfruitful for
purposes of research. The pioneer in this movement was Dr.
Lester F. Ward, whose masterly analysis of the psychic factors of
social phenomena gave the right direction for all time to sociological
inquiry, and whose emphasis of the importance of reason
and volition in the social process, although it has not yet received
the attention that it merits, is destined to be fruitful in coming
years.</p>

<p>To the further study of the psychological foundations of society
practically all the valuable work on fundamental social
problems has been given during the past ten years. Tarde has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
given us profound studies of imitation and invention; Gumplowicz
and Le Bon, of the psychology of races and culture groups;
Novicow, of the psychology of conflict and toleration; Le Bon
and Durkheim, of the psychology of crowds, of co-operation, and
of the division of labor; Baldwin, of the psychology of the social
unit&mdash;the <i>socius</i>.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that while sharp disagreements of opinion still
exist relative to the priority or the generality of one or another of
these psychic factors in the social process, discussion has focused
about the psychological phenomena themselves. There has been
a progressive limitation of the field and an increasing definiteness
of conception and hypothesis.</p>

<p>My own effort, if now I may be pardoned for referring to it,
has been to restrict the field yet further, and to make the problems
of sociology yet more specific. I have contended that these
psychological phenomena which have been seized upon for purposes
of sociological interpretation are still too vaguely conceived.
They are often disclosed to the inquirer in purely individual as
well as in social aspects. The lines of inquiry between the study
of mind in general, of mind as individual, and of mind as manifesting
itself socially in the concert or co-operation of a number
of individual minds, have not been drawn with sufficient precision.
I have tried to show that the psychological phenomena that Ward,
Tarde, Gumplowicz, Novicow, Le Bon, Durkheim, Baldwin, and
others have so admirably analyzed as psychic factors of society are
social when, and only when, they have certain coefficients, namely:
(1) The coefficient of resemblance&mdash;that is, a fundamental
similarity of individuals to one another underlying and, on the
whole, dominating their innumerable differences; (2) the coefficient
of awareness or consciousness of resemblance&mdash;that is to say,
certain feelings, perceptions, or thoughts of resemblance, which
give rise to varied prejudices and preferences that facilitate or
prevent effective co-operation. Whether this contention of mine
will prevail, whether there will ultimately be a general agreement
among sociologists that these coefficients of resemblance and consciousness
of kind are the true <i>differentia</i> of social phenomena,
time and further research must determine.</p>

<p>The second inquiry through which we may learn somewhat of
the present position of sociology relates to the development of
method. Exact method in social research is statistical. Wherever
we can obtain numerical data within the domain of social
phenomena, there we arrive at exact or quantitative knowledge.
The development and application of statistical methods to social
problems has been one of the most striking scientific achievements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of the present century. When Qu&eacute;telet, in 1835, published his
great work, <i>Sur l'Homme et le D&eacute;veloppement de ses Facult&eacute;s</i>, he
laid the foundation for a thorough statistical investigation of psychological
and sociological no less than of anatomical phenomena.
And after the publication, in 1846, of his work, <i>Sur la Th&eacute;orie des
Probabilit&eacute;s appliqu&eacute;es aux Sciences morales et politiques</i>, followed,
in 1848, by <i>Du Syst&egrave;me social et des Lois qui le r&eacute;gissent</i>, there
was a rapid development of statistical methods in precision, and of
attempts to extend the statistical method to groups of facts which
had until then been studied only from a purely qualitative or, at
best, a vaguely comparative point of view. At the present time
every subdivision of descriptive sociology draws data from rich
collections of statistical materials, and employs statistical methods
for the further extension of knowledge.</p>

<p>Thus, in the study of the social population, statistical methods
are employed not only to give the total number of inhabitants
dwelling within a given territory and the degree of density of
population per square mile, but also to show to what extent population
increases by births in excess of deaths, to what extent by
immigration in excess of emigration, and to what extent the composition
of the population is rendered complex by the intermingling
of many nationalities. The character of a population, also,
and its social capacities are in a large measure statistically investigated.
General intelligence is studied by means of statistics of literacy
and illiteracy; industrial preferences by statistics of occupation;
habits of industry by statistics of the number in every thousand
of the total population who regularly follow gainful occupations;
frugality by statistics of savings, insurance, and home ownership;
and the amount of communication, whereby assimilation and co-operation
are rendered possible, by statistics of travel, mail, and
telegraphic service.</p>

<p>Passing to that study of concerted feeling, thought, and purpose
which may be called a study of the social mind, and which
constitutes the second great division of descriptive sociology, we
find that it can be carried on, and that to a great extent it is prosecuted,
by means of statistical research. We have statistics incomplete,
but admitting of perfection, of those impulsive, emotional
disturbances of masses of men which take the form of strikes, insurrections,
lynchings, and revivals. The report of the United States
Department of Labor on strikes, published in 1894, and a recently
published monograph by Dr. Frederick S. Hall on Sympathetic
Strikes, show the possibilities of this method whenever it shall be
exhaustively applied. It could be successfully applied to the other
phenomena mentioned. By painstaking effort and a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
expenditure of money the data could be obtained. Lombroso and
Laschi, in their work, <i>Le Crime politique et les R&eacute;volutions</i>, have
made a beginning toward the collection of statistics of insurrections
and revolutions. More exact, at present, are our statistics
of the rational working of the minds of large numbers of men in
communication and co-operation. These we have in the familiar
form of election returns, which show us the decisions that communities
make on questions of public policy and administration.
This information could be increased by the application of statistical
analyses to the vast body of statute law and judicial decisions.
A beginning of such work has been made in the valuable Bulletin
of State Legislation, published by the New York State Library.</p>

<p>In the third division of descriptive sociology&mdash;that, namely,
which treats of social organization&mdash;the application of statistical
method is proceeding with great rapidity. We have not only statistics
(yearly improving in quality) of marriage and divorce, of
the organization of all governmental departments, military and
civil, of chartered corporations, of religious and educational societies,
but also of the thousands of associations formed for the promotion
of special interests, recreation, scientific research, art and
literature, and philanthropy. Every year the statistical information
on these matters, included in such compilations as The World
Almanac, becomes not only more extensive but more precise.</p>

<p>Yet more abundant are the statistical accumulations pertaining
to that fourth and last division of descriptive sociology which
treats of the social welfare&mdash;of the functioning of society, of the
ends for which it exists. We have statistics of prosperity, of the
accumulation and distribution of wealth, of the expansion and contraction
of credit, and of business failures. We have statistics of
longevity. We ascertain improving sanitary conditions by changes
in the death rate. We learn by statistical methods of the increase
or decrease of accident and death due to public disorder or maladministration.
We ascertain through educational statistics the
decrease of illiteracy and superstition. And by the same means
we ascertain the dimensions of pauperism and of crime. Not only
so, but, by a certain refinement of statistical method, applied by
competent men like Sir Francis Galton, we ascertain the increase
or decrease and the distribution of the higher manifestations of
intellectual ability and moral character.</p>

<p>Thus the whole field of descriptive sociology is being more and
more exhaustively studied by statistical methods that are yearly
improving in precision. So far, then, as may be judged from the
development of its methods, no science at the present time is making
surer and better progress than sociology, and none is offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to the general public conclusions based upon more exact methods
of induction.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the relations which the development of
statistical method bears to that development of fundamental
conceptions, which has already been described. Do we here discover
increasing harmony, a tendency toward co-ordination, or
have analyses of concepts, on the one hand, and developments
of statistical method, on the other hand, followed diverging
lines?</p>

<p>There can be no possible doubt of the answer that must be
made to these questions. Conceptions and methods are in as perfect
accord as can be discovered in any branch of science. The
merest glance over the field of social statistics shows that, for the
most part, they record and classify phenomena that are essentially
psychological. In working from the general theory of evolution
through the biological parallelism down to psychological premises,
analytical sociology has been doing in one way precisely what statistics
have been doing in another. The moment we pass from
statistics of density and distribution of population we find ourselves
dealing next with groups of facts that are biological (the
facts, namely, of distribution according to sex and age periods),
through facts that are partly biological and partly psychological
in character (the facts, namely, of nationality), and then, leaving
these behind, we deal henceforth entirely with facts that belong
to the mental and moral categories. To name them would be
only to repeat the categories already enumerated: the statistics
of intelligence, industry, and moral character, of emotional or
rational social action, of various forms of organization for the
achievement of as many different purposes, and of the development
of the conscious personality of man as a result of his social
relations and activities.</p>

<p>Not only is this true, but the further interesting fact may be
discovered that social statistics of every category employed or
known are based upon a frank recognition of that coefficient of
resemblance, physical or mental, which I have contended is a mark
of social phenomena. The first step in statistical tabulation is
classification, and classification invariably starts from an assumption
of real or supposed resemblance. Not to dwell on such fundamental
distinctions as those of color, race, and nationality, we
encounter the more special resemblances of agreement in religious
belief, agreement in industrial preference, agreement in political
conviction (as shown in election returns), similar susceptibility to
emotionalism, similar capacities for rational comprehension, similar
imperfections of nature, which result in lives of crime or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
pauperism. Remove from social statistics this postulate that blood
kinship or mental resemblance between one social unit and another
is the basis of social phenomena, and the statistics themselves
would cease to exist.</p>

<p>Statistics reveal also the consciousness which men have of their
resemblances and their differences. It is statistically known that
the geographical distribution of nationalities is not accidental or
capricious. Immigrant Italians, Germans, and Scandinavians find
their way to those parts of the country where men of their own
blood and speech are already established. Intermarriages of men
and women of different nationalities are statistically known to
be frequent where no differences of religion exist, and infrequent
where different nationalities profess different faiths. The statistics
of political elections are quite as much statistics of the consciousness
of kind as of differences of mental type itself.</p>

<p>The most significant fact of all, however, has still to be named.
It is this: From the first known beginnings of statistical research
to the present time every extension of statistical inquiry has been
in a large measure due to the consciousness of kind. The first
statistical surveys of communities of which we have any record
were such tribal enumerations as those recorded in the book of
Numbers, the avowed object of which was to ascertain the strength
and resources of the various tribes by clans, lesser gentile groups,
and households, not more for utilitarian reasons than for the gratification
of gentile and tribal pride. The census taken in Greece
in 594 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> was for the purpose of dividing the people into four
classes and levying taxes according to wealth. The constitution
of Servius Tullius, 550 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, distinguished six property classes, and
the attempt to determine these statistically was one of the earliest
experiments in census-making at Rome. The Domesday Book of
William I (1086) is the first great statistical document in English
history, and its origin was due to a desire to know not only
the military and fiscal strength of the nation, but also its class distinctions
and feudal relationships. The great stimulus given to
statistical investigation by the French Revolution was an obvious
product of class feeling. Most of the refinements of statistical
inquiry in later years have had a like origin. Such, for example,
was the cause of the discrimination in our own census of the foreign
born from the native born, and of the native born of foreign
parents from both native and foreign born. Such has been the
cause of the attempt to get more exact statistics of religious denominations,
of labor organizations, and of the distribution of
wealth. Had there been no reason for including these costly inquiries
in statistical investigations, except that of their general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
utility and scientific interest, the appropriation for them would
have been denied in Congress without an instant's hesitation.
They have been included because of the political deference given
to class feeling and to various forms of religious and educational
prejudice.</p>

<p>Thus there is seen to be a remarkable interdependence of statistical
method and psychological analysis in the development of
sociological research. Analysis and method have converged upon
the same postulates, and it is apparently by the development of
methods frankly founded upon these postulates that our sociological
knowledge is to be further increased.</p>

<p>It would be a great mistake, however, to assume that sociological
knowledge is to be increased only by the further collection
and interpretation of numerical data. Careful monographic
description and historical research must continue to be important
sources of both information and hypothesis. The great defects of
monographic work, both descriptive and historical, are, first, a certain
lack of precision, attributable to the large part played in
investigation by the individual judgment of the student (the lack
of objective tests by which his subjective impressions may be critically
examined); second, a certain incompleteness, attributable
to a failure to separate each inquiry into all its scientific subdivisions
and to attempt to obtain desired data under each subdivision,
as is done in statistical investigation where, in every table,
as many topics as there are scientific subdivisions of the general
subject are represented by columns, and an entry of some kind is
made in every column.</p>

<p>I wish now to point out the possibility of giving greater precision
to monographic work in sociology by the introduction of
quasi-statistical methods&mdash;methods that are essentially quantitative
in an algebraic sense, though they are not numerical.</p>

<p>Social phenomena have the interesting characteristic that small
forces, while never lost in that composition of forces which determines
the ultimate equilibrium of the social system, often count
for absolutely nothing in the practical affairs of a given generation.
If, for example, Mr. Bryan and a Democratic Congress had
been elected in 1896, the practical consequences for the United
States would have been much the same whether the Democratic
plurality had been one hundred thousand, half a million, or two
or three millions. This is but one example of a large class of
facts. Social phenomena are more often than not determined by
a mere matter of more or less, rather than by the exact amount
or degree of more or less. The determination is algebraic rather
than arithmetical. Is the element under investigation a positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
or a negative quantity? Is its sign plus or minus? That is usually
the important question for the sociological student.</p>

<p>Now it happens that a great many investigations in descriptive
sociology do not as yet admit of the introduction of exact statistical&mdash;that
is, arithmetical&mdash;inquiries which, nevertheless, do admit
the use of algebraically quantitative methods. In the monographic
description of a community many questions arise which
can not be answered by the entry of figures in a column, but which
could be answered by entering in a column a symbol indicating
that a certain trait, habit, or choice could be predicated of a
large majority, or of a small majority, or of only a large minority,
or of only a small minority of the entire population. That is to
say, it often happens that an observer who can not take a perfect
census (getting answers to all his questions from every individual
in the community), and who therefore can not fill out his columns
with arithmetical values, can, by such interviewing as is possible
to him and by such an examination of the objective products of
social activity as are open to the inspection of any one who chooses
to observe them critically, determine with absolute certainty
whether certain things are true of majorities or only of minorities.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that a traveler is studying an out-of-the-way
settlement, or a tribe, which presents many points of interest
that are comparatively novel. All who are familiar with the narratives
of travel and exploration which Mr. Spencer has used as
data for his Descriptive Sociology are aware that they are almost
totally devoid of system. The reader is told that such marriage
customs, such clan relationships, such political institutions, such
industrial operations, have been observed. The all-important coefficient
is left out. What the student of sociology would most
of all like to know is how many individuals in the community manifest
such or such a trait; how many have such or such a habit;
how many profess such or such a belief; how many adhere to this
organization, how many to that. But since this exact arithmetical
knowledge usually can not be obtained within the limited time
and under the circumstances of a traveler's researches, he should
try to get at least partially quantitative results by noting in every
instance whether the phenomenon observed is true of a majority
or only of a minority of the people under investigation.</p>

<p>This simple method admits of a high degree of refinement by
the obvious device of subdividing the total human mass under observation
into enumeration units. If, for example, we are studying
the social character and activities of the people of the United
States, we may take the fifty Commonwealths and Territories as
enumeration units. Making out a tabular form, we may enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in the left-hand column the names of the several States and Territories.
At the top of successive columns, counting from left to
right, we may enter words designating the social phenomena to
be observed. Then, taking the States and Territories in order, we
may enter opposite the name of each a symbol indicating that a
majority large or small, or a minority large or small, of the inhabitants
of the State or Territory in question manifests the trait
or follows the activity, or belongs to the social organization designated
at the top of the column. The symbols that I have found
most convenient in use are these: For a large majority, a double
plus sign thus, &#10746;; for a small majority, a single plus sign thus, +;
for a large minority, a double plus sign in a circle thus,
<img src="images/doubleplus.png" width="15" height="15" alt="[a double plus in a circle]" title="[a double plus in a circle]" />;
for a small minority, a single plus sign in a circle thus, &#10753;.</p>

<p>The great possibilities in this method of giving precision to
observations and records of the facts of social psychology and activity
become daily more obvious to students who practice it with
reasonable care. Almost any desired degree of accuracy can be
attained by taking smaller and smaller enumeration units. Thus,
if I wish to form and to record my judgment as to whether the
people of the United States as a whole manifest a high, a medium,
or a low degree of general intelligence, I seem to be raising a question
that admits of little better answer than a statement of vague
impressions. But let me take a concrete measure of high general
intelligence&mdash;for example, the general intelligence of a town noted
for its large proportion of scientific and professional men, its
graded schools, its satisfactory school attendance, and its low percentage
of illiteracy. Let me then subdivide the United States
into fifty parts&mdash;namely, the Commonwealths and Territories&mdash;and
let me enter in a column opposite the name of each a symbol
indicating that, as compared with the general intelligence of the
town which I have taken as a standard, a large majority or a small
majority, or a large minority or only a small minority, of the
people in that Commonwealth are of the high general intelligence;
that a large majority or a small majority, or a large minority or
only a small minority, are of medium intelligence; and that a large
majority or a small majority, or a large minority or a small minority,
are of low intelligence. Obviously, when I have completed this
process I have subjected my vague general impression that the people
of the United States as a whole are of high, medium, or low general
intelligence to a certain correction and measure. I count up
the entries in my columns. I discover that I have made, let us
say, nine entries indicating that a large majority of the people in
each of nine States are of high intelligence. I find that I have
made, let us say, eighteen entries indicating that in each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
eighteen States a small majority of the people are of low general intelligence;
and this mere counting of the entries may show me
that, when taking the States one by one, I have made a somewhat
different estimate of the general intelligence of the people of the
entire country from that which I made when looking at all the
people of the country as an undivided mass.</p>

<p>If still unsatisfied with my judgment, I may proceed to subdivide
each State into its counties, and take the counties as enumeration
units. I may go through the process of recording my
judgments by entering symbols in the several columns of my table,
and at the end I may again count up my totals of high, medium,
and low intelligence. Obviously, I can do this work only if I am
able to travel through every county in the United States, and, by interviews
with people, by forming general impressions and by visiting
schools, get a fairly definite idea of the relative intelligence
of each civil division; or if, being unable to make this personal
inquiry, I resort to printed information&mdash;namely, educational reports,
miscellaneous public documents, historical records, newspapers,
and other objective data throwing light upon the intellectual
status of these various divisions. This, I find, is an enormous
labor; but if I conscientiously perform it I correct my subjective
impressions, and there is a fair presumption that my final result
is a judgment vastly nearer the truth than was my first general
impression of the intelligence of the whole undivided mass of the
American population.</p>

<p>Thus the conscientious use of the method which I have suggested
insures, in the interest of precision, two important modifications
of ordinary sociological description: First, it subjects the
purely subjective processes of judgment to a certain correction and
measurement; secondly, it leads the observer step by step, and
almost unconsciously, to resort more and more to definite objective
data in place of first impressions.</p>

<p>Essentially the same method, by slight modifications of detail,
may be extended to historical inquiries. How often do we encounter
in historical monographs the statement that, since a certain
date, there has been a marked increase of this or that activity,
or that such a trait or such a habit, occasionally observed half a
century ago, is now characteristic of whole sections or populations!
To the credit of the historians, it must be said that careful
men seldom make such statements without offering in substantiation
of them a certain amount of objective evidence. But the
method is loose, and it has the radical defect of permitting such
terms as "increase" and "decrease," "great increase" and "great
decrease" to stand for different quantities when applied to different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
phenomena under examination in the same treatise. There
is no uniformity of measurement. Now, it is easy to introduce
uniformity, even where arithmetical values are not known. It is
possible to know that we are applying the same method of measurement
when we say that, since 1850, there has been a "great"
multiplication of lynchings in the United States that we apply when
we say that there has been a "great" increase of population, although,
in the case of the lynchings, we have not arithmetical
values, while in the case of the increase of population we have.</p>

<p>This can be done in the following way: Distinguish and designate
degrees of increase or decrease by symbols thus: No change,
= 0; absolute increase but relative decrease, = +1; absolute increase
with no relative decrease, = +2; great absolute increase
without relative decrease, = +3; absolute and relative increase,
= +4; absolute decrease but relative increase, = -1; absolute
decrease without relative increase, = -2; great absolute decrease
without relative increase, = -3; absolute and relative decrease,
= -4.</p>

<p>Now let the historian who wishes to pass in review the quantitative
changes that have occurred since a given time&mdash;for example,
1850&mdash;before he puts on paper his impressions, based upon
such evidence as he has been able to collate, put down all these
symbols against the name of each of the social phenomena which
he is studying. He will instantly see that he is trying to apply
to each of the phenomena whose changes he wishes to record a
certain scale of measurement, and he at once asks himself: What
do I really mean by such a term as "relative" increase or decrease
when contrasted with "absolute" increase or decrease; and what
do I mean by such a term as "great" increase or decrease when
contrasted with such a term as "increase" or "decrease" without
a modifying word? The moment he puts these questions before
his mind he will feel a sinking of heart as he reviews the pages
in which he has confidently told his readers that such "absolute"
and "relative" changes have from time to time occurred, and reflects
that he has seldom been consistent in his use of these terms.</p>

<p>How, then, shall he attain consistency and precision? To be
consistent and precise in the use of the word "relative" it is
necessary to make at the outset an arbitrary choice of a term of
comparison, just as in making comparative judgments of such a
phenomenon as general intelligence it is necessary to take as a
standard the phenomenon as observed in a particular community.
The most suitable term of comparison for all judgments of increase
or decrease in social phenomena is the increase or decrease of population
per square mile within the area and during the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
studied. The increase of population is arithmetically measured, and
it stands in relations of direct causation to every social change.
The historian, therefore, in forming his judgments of relative increase
or decrease should always take the increase or decrease of
population per square mile as his term of comparison.</p>

<p>What meaning, finally, shall be attached to the word "great"
when the historian wishes to distinguish "great" increase or
"great" decrease from "increase" or "decrease" in general, and
absolute statistics are not available? There is one, and, as far as
I can see, only one, perfectly satisfactory procedure.</p>

<p>Let the investigator subdivide the community which he is studying
into enumeration units according to the method suggested
above for the descriptive monograph. Let him then make as
many tables as there are ten-year periods in the general historical
period that he is investigating. That is to say, let him make a
table for 1850, for 1860, for 1870, for 1880, and for 1890. Let
him then proceed according to the method laid down for the descriptive
monograph, entering opposite each Commonwealth the symbol
for majority or minority, thus showing by States, for each of the
ten-year periods, the prevalence of the trait or activity under investigation.
Suppose, for example, that the phenomenon studied
is the growth of popular interest in prize fighting since 1850. The
historian should begin by asking, In what States, if any, in 1850
were large majorities of the people interested in prize fights to
the extent of countenancing them and eagerly following their
progress? In what States were only small majorities so interested,
in what States only large minorities, and in what ones
only small minorities? The best answers that the historian can
make to these questions, after examining all the evidence that he
can command, he should record by entering the proper symbol
against each State, after which he should repeat the procedure
for the date 1860, for the date 1870, and so on. When his tables
are thus completed, he should count up the number of entries of
each symbol in each table. If then he finds that in less than half
of his enumeration units&mdash;i. e., in less than half of all the States
and Territories&mdash;small minorities have become large minorities,
large minorities have become small majorities, or small majorities
have become large, he will be justified in concluding that there
has been an increase, but not a "great" increase, in popular interest
in prize fighting. If, however, he discovers that these
changes have occurred in more than half of his enumeration units,
he can say with reason that the increase of interest in prize fighting
has been "great."</p>

<p>Cases may arise in which a correction of the judgment thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
formed may be necessary. It might be erroneous to say that
there had been no great increase of interest in prize fighting if it
were discovered that the increase had occurred in two or three
Commonwealths only, but that in them it had been phenomenal.
The method itself, however, reveals the necessity for correction
in such cases and measures the error; for, obviously, a phenomenal
increase or decrease in any one enumeration unit would be disclosed
by a dropping of the intermediate symbols between &#10753; and
&#10746;. That is to say, small minorities would become majorities, or
great majorities would become small minorities, within an interval
during which lesser changes were occurring elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thus, by taking a little trouble, the historian can apply one
constant measure to his judgments of increase and decrease, as he
reviews social changes. He must subdivide his community into
enumeration units, and against each unit, at each convenient date,
he must enter a record of his judgment that the trait, activity,
interest, or relation under investigation can be predicated of a large
or of only a small majority, of a large or of only a small minority,
of the individuals composing the enumeration unit. He must
then count up the changes from minority to greater minority or
to majority, or from majority to minority. Conscientiously following
this method, the historian may often make comparisons of
great precision, when otherwise his comparisons, made without reference
to a common measure, would be little more than suppositions.</p>

<p>Following such methods as these, the writers of descriptive and
historical monographs can increase our approximately exact sociological
knowledge. Constructing and filling out such tables as
have been described, they can bring to light serious gaps in our
numerical statistics, and they can thereby suggest and stimulate
new statistical inquiries. Thus co-operating, the descriptive writers,
the historians, and the statisticians can in time perfect our
descriptive sociology, and, co-operating with those students who are
completing the analysis of fundamental concepts, they can gradually
give precision to our formulations of sociological law.</p>

<h2>VINLAND AND ITS RUINS.</h2>

<p class="center">SOME OF THE EVIDENCES THAT NORTHMEN WERE IN MASSACHUSETTS IN PRE-COLUMBIAN DAYS.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By CORNELIA HORSFORD.</span></p>


<p>The evidences that Northmen were in Massachusetts in pre-Columbian
days are drawn from two sources, geography and
arch&aelig;ology. The arch&aelig;ological evidence is found by comparing
certain ruins in Massachusetts with ruins of the Saga-time in Iceland,
and also with the native and early European ruins on the
coast of North America. The geographical evidence is found by
comparing the descriptions of the country called Vinland in Icelandic
literature with the coast of North America.</p>

<p>The geographical data for this paper are taken from each and
all of the three oldest manuscript versions of the story of Vinland,
because they complement each other where the descriptions vary
in detail. These are called the Flat Island Book, Eric the Red's
Saga, and Thorfinn Karlsefni's Saga.</p>

<p>If the coast of North America should repeat the same geographical
features, it would obviously be impossible to determine
the site of Vinland by geography alone. Let us see if this is so.
It is stated in Eric the Red's Saga that Karlsefni's party, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
consisted of one hundred and sixty men and their live stock in
three vessels, after sailing southwest from Greenland for a number
of days and seeing two new countries, came to a certain cape.
"They cruised along the land and the land lay on the starboard....
There were there an open, harborless coast and long strands and
sand banks. And they went in boats to the land and found there
the keel of a ship, and they named it Keel Cape. And they gave
a name to the strands and called them Wonder Strands, because
they were long to sail by. Then the land became scored with bays,
and they steered the ships to the bays."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They remained here for
some time, but they had not yet seen the Vinland which Leif Erikson
had found a few years before.</p>

<p>Thorhall started to seek for it "northward round Wonder-strand
and westward off Keel Cape." Therefore we must first
look for a cape, the trend of whose shore is north and south, with
open water west of it, and beyond that again land. This cape must
have a long, sandy, harborless coast, with sand banks on the east,
and it must be broken up into bays farther to the south, and one
of these bays must be large enough and deep enough for three
vessels, one of which could carry at least fifty men across the
Atlantic. The icelandic word "&ouml;r&#339;fi" which is used in this text
means "harborless," and is the descriptive local name of the convex,
sandy, unsheltered coast of southern Iceland (Or&#339;fa), the
present Skaptafells district, from Stokksnes to Dyrh&oacute;laey. This
gives a clear idea of what we ought to look for along the coast
of North America.</p>

<p>The eastern coast of North America<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> shows us that, south of
rock-bound Labrador, the only places north of New York where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
capes are to be found jutting northward from the land are northern
Newfoundland, Cape Breton Island, the southern shores of
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Cape Ann, and Cape Cod.</p>

<p>There is no stretch of open, harborless, sandy coast from
Cape Bauld to Cape Spear, with its steep, sterile, rocky shores.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
There are two or three stretches of unbroken coast from three
to five miles long, north and south of Canada Bay, northwest of
Conception Bay, and northeast of Bonavista Bay, but these are
not the shores of capes jutting to the north, with long strands and
sand banks.</p>

<p>If we begin with Cape Breton and follow the coast northward
we find no extensive stretch of harborless coast until we reach
Island Point. From this point to Cape Smoke there is a comparatively
unbroken coast about thirty miles in extent whose "headlands
are composed of primary and metamorphic rocks, principally
granite, with clay slate in nearly vertical strata, while sandstone,
conglomerate, shale, limestone, and occasionally beds of
gypsum and red and yellow marl occur on the intervening shores."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Here, then, there are not long strands and sand banks. Cape North
is a headland of slate one thousand feet high.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Dr. Gustav Storm,
of the University of Christiania, in his well-known book, <i>Studier
over Vinlandsreiserne, etc.</i>, page 42, points out a resemblance between
Cape Breton and Keel Cape, and states that the eastern
shores of Cape Breton Island are "specially described as low-lying
and sandy." According to the United States Hydrographic Office
Report, No. 99, page 289, the southeast coast of Cape Breton
Island from Michaux Point to Cape Gabarus "is low and has a
barren and rocky appearance, and the shore is broken into numerous
lakes and ponds, protected from the sea by beaches of gravel
and some small rocky islands and ledges.... From Cape Gabarus
to Cape Breton, a distance of fifteen miles, the land is of
moderate height and the shore broken into coves and small harbors."
Between Louisburg and Cape Breton, eight miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
beyond, "there are three small harbors, too intricate and rocky in
their entrances to admit vessels of any burden," and Cape Breton
itself is "low and rocky and covered with grassy moors." This is
unlike the open, harborless coast with long strands and sand banks
of the Sagas. Within the Gulf of St. Lawrence the capes which
jut to the north are Cape St. George,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with rocky, precipitous
cliffs six hundred feet above the sea; North Point,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> on Prince Edward
Island, which is broken about five miles down the coast by
Tignish River, and beyond that by the red sandstone cliff of Cape
Kildare; Escuminiac Point,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> at the entrance to Miramichi Bay,
a broken coast with low sandstone cliffs; and Birch Point,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on
Miscou Island, with a steep cliff of sandstone ten feet high.</p>

<p>Campobello is a rocky island, and Cape Ann is rocky and has
no long, harborless coast.</p>

<p>Cape Cod<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> juts to the north with open water west of it, and
beyond that again land. It has also a long, harborless coast on
the east, with strands and sand banks, and is scored with bays
toward the south.</p>

<p>Cape Cod, then, is the only cape north of Sandy Hook which
corresponds to the description in the Saga, and near here we should
look for Vinland, leaving the southern shores until later.</p>

<p>Vinland, which was discovered by Leif Erikson, is only described
as <i>Vinland</i> in the Flat Island Book. This account states
that Leif Erikson's party "came to a certain island which lay north
of the land." That Leif Erikson should have thought that Cape
Cod was an island is obvious, because it is impossible from the cape
to see the southern shore of Massachusetts Bay twenty miles away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
There is no need to explain why he also believed it to lie north of
the land, as no one and final answer can be given, although several
can be easily suggested; that water and land again lay to the
west is clearly stated in all three accounts.</p>

<p>Afterward "they sailed into that sound which lay between the
island and the promontory which jutted northward from the land;
they steered in westward past the promontory. There was much
shallow water at ebb tide, and then their ship stood up and then
it was far to look to the sea from their ship." Across the water
which lies between Cape Cod and the mainland is Rocky Point,
a high and therefore noticeable promontory jutting northward
from the land. Past this one can only continue westering to the
north, and thence we must now look along the land to find the
place where, in the words of the Flat Island Book, "a certain
river flowed out of a certain lake," having, as was said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
great shallows at its mouth at ebb tide, whence it was far to look
to the ocean.</p>

<p>Following round the inner coast of Cape Cod, we pass Plymouth
and on to Boston before we find in the Charles River and Boston
Back Bay a river flowing through a lake into the sea, where great
shallows at its mouth are a conspicuous feature and it is far to
look to the ocean.</p>

<p>At this point we may add one more feature to the description
of Keel Cape&mdash;that it appears to be an island when approached
from the north. Now we can continue our search down the North
Atlantic coast, noting that Sandy Hook is not scored with bays at
the south, and that Cape Henlopen and Cape Henry could not
have been mistaken for islands.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>There is one event described in all three versions of the Vinland
story&mdash;the battle with the natives. According to the Flat Island
Book, this battle took place in Vinland; according to the other
two Sagas, Vinland was supposed to be north of Keel Cape. But
in these Sagas it is said that this battle took place <i>south</i> of Keel
Cape, where Karlsefni had found a river flowing through a lake
into the sea.</p>

<p>It was this word south which led the Danish arch&aelig;ologist Carl
Christian Rafn to think that Vinland was in Rhode Island. Although
there is no land south of Cape Cod (with the exception of
Nantucket Island) between Cape Cod and Santo Domingo, it is only
fair to look once more at Mount Hope Bay<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> (Rafn's Vinland) to
see whether it really corresponds to the description before us. The
Taunton River flows through Mount Hope Bay to the sea, but there
are no shallows here, and the mouth of the river looks directly out,
southward and not eastward, to the open ocean. In Boston Harbor,
moreover, are great tongues of land and islands such as are described
in Eric the Red's Saga. There is perhaps cause for comment
in the use of the word "fj&ouml;ll," fells or mountains (according
to Vigfusson<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>), applied to the hills about Boston, of which
the highest, "Blue Hill," is seven hundred and ten feet high. If
"fells" is a correct translation, it would be unobjectionable.</p>

<p>One morning Karlsefni saw the natives in their skin boats rowing
toward his house, from the south, past a promontory. It is
not difficult to find the only promontory past which canoes could
have come from the south between the mouth of the river and
Watertown, the head of navigation. Here, then, Leif Erikson and
Thorfinn Karlsefni should have built their houses, if this history
be true, because this place corresponds with the description of
Vinland, and also because we can find no other place on the coast
like it.</p>

<p>Having found what appears to be the site of Thorfinn Karlsefni's
houses, it is well to inquire next what the characteristic
features of the Norse houses of the Saga-time were, and what traces
one might hope to find after nearly nine hundred years.</p>

<p>Icelandic homesteads of that period usually consisted of a main
house, composed of three or four apartments and one or two outhouses,
built on the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>The walls were one and a half metres thick, and from one to
one and a half metres high, built of alternate layers of turf and
stones on the inside and on the outside, the space between being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
filled in with earth. Often, however, the walls were built entirely
of turf and earth, or with only disconnected rows of stones at the
base. Wood also was sometimes used. It is stated in Thorfinn
Karlsefni's Saga that some of the trees in Vinland were "so large
they were laid in a house."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plan of the House of Eric the Red in Iceland.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A long, narrow fireplace usually extended through the middle
of the principal room, and an essential feature was the cooking
fireplace, which was about one metre square. These were either
paved or surrounded by upright stones. The plan is of the ruin
of the house of Eric the Red in Haukadalr, Iceland. It shows the
different forms of fireplace, and that the walls, which were built of
turf, were one and a half metres thick. Outhouses were often
dug into the hillside, and were sometimes walled up on the inside
with stone and turf. Ruins of such old settlements in Iceland are
usually low, grass-grown ridges and hollows.</p>

<p>When Professor Horsford first visited the site which his study
of maps and literature had led him to believe was Vinland, he
found a few hollows in the hillside and also some broad, low ridges
on the level ground, indicating that a building about twenty metres
long by five metres broad had once stood there. There was also
a mound some distance away which has since proved to be of modern
construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>No digging was done here until after Professor Horsford's
death, with the exception of a few trenches across the supposed
site of Leif Erikson's house on the other side of the creek. In
1896, during a visit of Dr. Valtyr Gudmundsson and Mr. Thorsteinn
Erlingsson, of Copenhagen and Iceland, extensive excavations
were made, leaving practically nothing unexamined at
this site.</p>

<p>Three kinds of earth were revealed. The upper layer was
of black loam from thirty to forty centimetres deep; below this
was a yellow soil of sand and clay thirty centimetres deep; and
below that again the sand and gravel which had remained undisturbed
since the close of the Glacial epoch.</p>

<p>The ruins were at the junction of the black and yellow earth.
Throughout the black loam to the bottom, wherever we dug, within
or away from the ruins, were scattered fragments of china, glass,
glazed pottery, nails, pipestems, broken bricks, etc., all belonging
to the period of the occupation of this region by the English.
None of these were found in places where their presence would
show that they belonged to or preceded these ruins. In the paved
pathway, which will be described later, a few pieces of brick lie
between the stones,
but not deeper than
similar fragments of
brick were found in
the undisturbed earth
near by, apparently
trodden in by the cattle
which have been
pastured there for
years. There were
also objects of aboriginal
manufacture,
such as stone implements,
pottery, pieces
of flint, etc. Occasionally,
at different levels, remains of fires were found, some of
which were merely thin layers of charcoal and ashes. There were,
however, two well-built fireplaces, in good condition, entirely unlike
each other. One of these was an Indian clambake, neatly
paved and piled with ashes and unopened clam shells. This lay
sixty-three centimetres below the sod. The photograph is not of
this fireplace, but is a good example of all Indian fireplaces or clambakes
in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The second fireplace, which was about one metre square, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
by upright stones at the four corners and filled with oak
charcoal, but no ashes, was the distinctive feature of this ruin,
and resembled the cooking fireplaces of the Icelanders. The
absence of ashes has been accounted for by absorption in the
soft clay soil. Ashes
often disappear in
this way, but can be
detected with acids.</p>

</div>

<p>Although the outline
of the walls of
the long house can
only be suggested,
the few stones which
were found at the
base of the old walls
were placed about a
metre and a half
apart, as in the walls of the Saga-time. This, so far as is known,
is peculiar to that period and race. Iroquois long houses were
constructed for communal use, and were usually from one hundred
to three hundred feet long. The chief traces left are fire
rows and kitchen middens. They are not known to have used
stone foundations, nor to have made any attempt at regularity of
outline. The drawing shows the method of construction of these
long houses, which were built only by the Indians of the Iroquois
tribe.</p>

<p>Depressions which appeared to be the sites of old huts were
in the hillside back of the terrace on which the long house stood,
but the roadway in front had apparently destroyed all but one of
these, and had also carried away the front wall of this.</p>

<p>This hut was four metres across the front, and may have been
five metres deep. When the sod, stones, and the clearings, which
had been thrown in from the cultivated field above, were all removed,
the remains of two side walls were found, supported and
protected by the upper portions of these same walls which had
slipped down from above and lay close to them, forming a compact
mass of earth and stones. None of the stones in this wall were
in contact with each other, being separated by two or three inches
of dark earth such as results from the decay of vegetable matter.
There was no fireplace. The manner of constructing these walls
was the counterpart of Icelandic work. I shall now show you how
this differs from post-Columbian cellars.</p>

Iceland. It shows the sod between the stones closely packed but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
distinct. The stones in our early English and French cellars practically
touch each other, as in the old cellar in Fort William Henry,
in Maine. Sometimes broken stones fill the interstices, as in another
example of stonework at Fort William Henry. Mortar has
been used here more or less since the beginning of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Although European or post-Columbian walls and cellars differ
considerably among themselves, it is within certain limits. Post-Columbian
walls, or foundation walls when built on the surface
of the ground, were practically homogeneous in character, the
French only attaining to one metre in thickness, whereas Icelandic
walls were disposed in three distinct parts, the inner and outer
sides being constructed in layers and the space between being filled
in with closely packed earth, while they were never less than a
metre and a half thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Icelandic outhouses when dug into a hillside dispensed with
the triple wall at the back and on the sides, and thus when stone-faced
partially resemble our cellars. But even then they still
retain one characteristic
feature, in their
alternate layers of
turf and stone.</p>

<p>While this hut
was being dug out,
our attention was
called to stones protruding
through the
turf a short distance
away and nearer to
the water. When the
earth was cleared
away, it proved to
be a rude stone-laid
pathway leading along the margin of the old creek to the river.
Here at the landing place a similar pathway branched away in
another direction, stopping suddenly a few metres south of the
supposed house of Thorfinn Karlsefni. This pathway is called in
Iceland a <i>sj&aacute;var-gata</i>, or path to the sea. Ancient pavings have
been found at Fort William Henry, near Pemaquid, Maine. They
are, however, similar to many street pavements still to be found
in our eastern cities. There is also a remarkable paved gutter
at the Lewis Farm,
in Maine, which has
long interested historians.
But none of
these resemble the
<i>sj&aacute;var-gata</i> in its peculiar
construction,
especially where it
broadens and divides
with a wide margin of
pebbles on one side
and small heaps of
stones on the other.</p>

<p>This map was
made for Professor
Horsford about ten years ago. It shows the site of the long house,
in which the Icelandic fireplace was found, and the cot, in which
Icelandic walls were found. The paved path ran along the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
in front. Professor Horsford fixed Thorfinn's landing place a
short distance south of this, on solid ground. Geologists are unable
to say how long ago the salt marshes were formed. They are on
Winthrop's map of 1634, but the <i>sj&aacute;var-gata</i> could hardly have
been accessible as a landing place after their formation.</p>

<p>In summary, it may be said that at the only point of land on
the coast of North America which we have found to correspond
with the description of the site of Thorfinn Karlsefni's houses,
ruins have been dug out which bear peculiar features characteristic
of the period in Iceland known as the Saga-time, and differing
in certain essential features from the handiwork of all the
native races of North America, and, as far as is known at present,
from all other races in Europe or in America in post-Columbian
days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><i>Extracts from the Reports of Dr. Gudmundsson and Mr. Erlingsson.</i></p>

<p>The following extracts, from reports by Dr. Gudmundsson and Mr.
Erlingsson, refer to the ruins described in the preceding paper. The
plan for these researches was first to compare the aforesaid ruins with
the work of the native races supposed to have inhabited or visited these
shores, next with that of the Norsemen of the eleventh century, and
later, if necessary, with the earliest English, French, Spanish, and Dutch
ruins on these shores. Dr. Gudmundsson and Mr. Erlingsson noted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
points of resemblance between these and Icelandic ruins, and in their
reports by request wrote everything they could think of in opposition
to, as well as in favor of, their being of Norse origin.</p>

<p>When these gentlemen left Cambridge the characteristic features of
the early post-Columbian ruins on this coast had not been ascertained,
and these researches were not finished satisfactorily until a year and a
half after the Icelanders returned to Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center"><i>From Dr. Gudmundsson's Report.</i></p>

<p>The next place into which we dug was a depression or hollow in the
hillside in a northerly direction from the above-mentioned place. Here
we found unquestionable remains of a house which had been dug into
the hillside, with walls constructed of stones, and layers of earth between
the single rows of stones. The foundation and the lower parts of the
two side walls were solid and well preserved, but the whole back wall,
with the exception of a single row (the foundation), had fallen down.
The stones from this and the upper parts of the side walls covered the
whole bottom, so that they at the first glance seemed to form a pavement.
When carefully examined, it was evident, however, that most of
the stones which covered the bottom belonged to the walls, though some
might have rolled down from the hill above the house. Thus it could
clearly be seen how some of the stones had fallen down from the walls
and some were just sliding down, without having as yet reached to the
bottom, as some stones underneath had hindered them from gliding farther.
The front wall of the house was wanting, and must either have
been of wood or&mdash;which seems most likely&mdash;have been spoiled when the
road which runs close past the house was made. When the bottom was
cleared of the stones which had fallen in it proved to consist of a level
black floor.</p>

<p>The construction and situation of this house are <i>quite</i> Scandinavian,
built in the same way as houses in Iceland and Greenland. I would
therefore not have had the least hesitation to declare it to be a ruin of
a house built by Scandinavians in the pre-Columbian period if between
and under the stones which covered the bottom we had not found some
pieces of glazed pottery and bricks, of which some small pieces were
found trodden down even into the floor itself. This seems to indicate
that the house must be post-Columbian, or at least have been occupied
by the first English or French colonists. As in the meantime several
American scholars, with whom I have had an opportunity to discuss this
matter, positively declare that the post-Columbian colonists never would
have built such walls of stones without mortar, and it must be regarded
as <i>quite</i> certain that Indian people could not have built it, there seems
to be no other explanation possible than that this ruin must be Scandinavian,
and, having been found by some of the first post-Columbian colonists
(e. g., some fishermen), had been repaired and occupied by them for a
shorter or longer time. If it can be proved that such a building as this
could not have been built by the post-Columbian colonists nor by Indians,
it can hardly be anything else than Scandinavian. This, however, must
be left to American scholars, who have sufficient knowledge in these matters.
But so long as this is not proved, the pieces of pottery and bricks
which were found in it rather seem to speak for its post-Columbian origin,
as those pieces must have been there when the house fell down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
such a house as this built in the beginning of the eleventh century could
not have stood five hundred years before its roof and the upper parts of
the walls fell down.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road we found an end of an old path paved
with small stones, running from the house in the hillside along the edge
of the old river bank down to a kind of promontory which in olden time,
when the water stood much higher than it now does, seems to have served
as a landing place. In the middle of this path, which was from about
six to ten inches under the surface, was a hollow as trodden down by the
feet of men and (perhaps) horses. This path is very like Icelandic paths,
such as may still be found in many places in Iceland. But as we in some
places in this path found some bricks between the stones which formed
its pavement, it must be regarded as doubtful whether it is Scandinavian.
The bricks seem rather to speak for a post-Columbian origin, though
the whole path is so primitive that it hardly can be suggested that so
advanced a people as the first post-Columbian colonists should have made
such a path. To settle the question whether it could belong to those
colonists must be left to American scholars. This path seems, at any
rate, to have been made by the same people who built the house in the
hillside, so either both of them must be regarded as post-Columbian or
they both are Scandinavian. Another path runs from this landing place
in a westerly direction along the old river bank, where it stops very
abruptly on a certain spot a very short distance east of the supposed
"Thorfinn's house." As I could not find any other reason for its stopping
on this spot than that near it stood a building, I examined the river
bank beside it, and here I found the earth, about eight inches under the
surface, mixed with charcoal, which could indicate that some refuse from
a house had been thrown there. This seems to lead to the conclusion
that there at the end of this path really has stood a building, of which
we could not now expect to find any traces, or even a building constructed
of turf only (turf walls), which also might have wholly disappeared,
as earth walls on an elevated ground like this perhaps might have
blown away.</p>

<p>The result of these researches is briefly, according to my opinion, this:
As far as concerns the construction, both the house in the hillside and
the two paths, or the two branches of the path, could be of Scandinavian
origin, but I am not so well acquainted with the life and customs of
the first post-Columbian colonists as to be able to decide whether they
could not have been made by them. This, therefore, must be left to
American scholars.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From Mr. Erlingsson's Report.</i></p>

<p>It is not uncommon in Iceland that houses, especially small outhouses,
are dug into small hills, hillsides, or sloping ground, just as this
house is. It is, in fact, built very like what I have seen in outhouses in
many places in Iceland, and what is left of the walls here nobody could
distinguish from Icelandic walls. The size and the whole form is also
very like an outhouse, but as most frequently in outhouses either all the
four walls are made of stones or none of them, it would seem strange
that one of the walls here is completely wanting. But those stones which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
were used in it could have been used in the road which has been made
past the house, or, besides, it is possible that the front wall of the house
has been a wooden one, and, although this is very rare in outhouses certainly,
yet it must be taken into consideration that here it is much
easier to procure wood than in Iceland. The whole form, the method,
and the condition of the house itself seemed like nothing else than that
it was built by Icelandic hands, although some of the stones seem to be
rather small, but, as pieces of pottery and bricks have been found beneath
the stones which had fallen down from the walls and on the floor itself,
it seems to prove sufficiently that the house can not belong to the old
Icelandic period; but as nobody has expected such a house here, the discovery
is very remarkable.</p>

<p>This path is so like paths in Iceland, for which there have been gathered
stones and which later on have been trodden down by the feet of
horses and men, that I would not have hesitated to declare that it might
be Scandinavian if in it there had not been found bricks beside the other
stones, which seems to indicate that the path must belong to the same
period as the house which was dug into the hill. This discovery must
therefore, too, be regarded as very remarkable....</p>

<h2>THE EDUCATION OF THE NEMINIST.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By DAVID STARR JORDAN</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">PRESIDENT OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY.</span></p>


<p>The meeting of the Astral Club of Alcalde, on September 10,
1899, was rendered memorable by the return, from a month's
absence in the East, of the secretary of the club, Miss Corintha
Jones, D. N. N. N. Her presence had been sorely missed at the
August meeting (though I say it who should not), for it is not
often that one of our devoted band is absent from his post.</p>

<p>Miss Jones had left Alcalde to complete a course of study in
medicine in one of the most famous colleges of the East. At the
suggestion of the president of the club, Mr. Asa Marvin, F. T. S.,
the usual programme was suspended on her return, and Miss Doctress
Jones, D. N. N. N. (for such indeed is the title she has now
earned), told us of her studies at the Massachusetts University of
Mentiphysics, in Boston, a noble institution, up to date in all respects,
for it received its charter from the General Assembly of
Massachusetts in the year 1881.</p>

<p>Miss Doctress Jones left her home in Alcalde on the 20th of
July, designing to visit certain relatives residing at Homer and
Virgil, Cortland County, N. Y., on the way. She reached Boston
on the 5th day of August, and at once proceeded to the university. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
ignorant hackman took her over to the suburban village of Cambridge,
which is the seat of Harvard College. Making inquiry of
the professors there, she found none who had ever heard of the
University of Mentiphysics, having eyes and ears for nothing but
Harvard, which in some respects is indeed a great institution, but
on a material plane.</p>

<p>At last, after much inquiry, Doctress Jones was sent to the
Neministic Headquarters, a small building on the corner of Milk
and Transcendental Streets. Here she learned, from a little lady
with a withered face and a serene smile, that the University of
Mentiphysics was situated not in Boston, but in the neighboring
town of Lynn, which lies some miles to the north. "But in Massachusetts,"
she said, "we call it all Boston."</p>

<p>"So I took the train for Lynn," Miss Doctress Jones continued,
"and drove at once to the street and number named on the card.
The little white house with green blinds, white columns on the
veranda, and a few weedy roses in the front yard did not fill my
conception of a university, for it did not look like our universities
in California. But the fault was with my conception, not with
the fact.</p>

<p>"The maid who answered the bell assured me that this was
indeed the university, and ushered me at once into the office of the
president. The wall was covered with pictures and photographs,
showing elderly ladies with serene smiling faces. Under each one
were the letters N. N. N., and a card giving an account of how each
one had been made whole and happy through Neministic Science.
The president was a middle-aged, matronly lady, with a high forehead
and brown hair, streaked with gray, done in graceful frizzes
over her brow. Above the corners of her mouth, which were always
drawn up in an engaging smile, were three deep creases. Mr.
Gridley, our schoolmaster, tells me that these correspond to the
grave accent in Greek, and that there being three of them shows
that the lady had been married three times. I do not know as to
this, but somehow her face seemed startlingly familiar and at the
same time strangely pleasant.</p>

<p>"I murmured something about having had the pleasure before.
She said, taking the words from my mouth: 'I know what you are
going to say. We are indeed very much alike, though she is on
the material plane. Still, my friends call me the "Lydia Pinkham
of the soul," and I do not resent it, for what dear Lydia tries
to do, that I do.'</p>

<p>"I told the president," Doctress Jones continued, "that I wished
to learn the wisdom of Boston, and especially the science of Neministic
Healing, of which I had heard much in Alcalde. 'But perhaps I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
call at the university, and not trouble you in your rest
at home.' At this her eyes blazed, and she said, with a tragic air:
'Having eyes, ye see not! I read the Soul and the Stars through
a higher than mortal sense. Has the Sun forgotten to shine and
the Planets to revolve around it? Who was it discovered, demonstrated,
and teaches the marvel of Neministic Healing? That one,
whoever it be, does understand something of what can not be lost.'</p>

<p>"I looked dazed. She quieted down and explained to me that
she was herself the university, because no one but herself could
explain what was revealed to her alone. The whole Neministic
Science was taught in twelve lessons, and I could begin then and
there.</p>

<p>"I said something about preparatory work and the books I
would need to read. She placed in my hands a slip which read:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. Persons contemplating a course in the Massachusetts
University of Mentiphysics can prepare for it through no
books save Neministic Science and Astral Health, with a Key to the
Stars. Man-made theories are narrow, else extravagant, and always
materialistic. <i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>' Then she added: 'I
recommend students not to read so-called scientific works antagonistic
to Neministic Healing, which advocate material systems, because
such works and words becloud the right sense of Mentiphysical
Science. A primary student richly imbued with the Neministic
spirit is a better healer and teacher than a normal-class student,
who partakes less of this power. Even an apt scholar who has
dipped into my Neministic Science and Astral Health, with a Key
to the Stars (the last revised edition), may enter this field of labor,
without any personal instruction, beneficially to himself and the
race.'</p>

<p>"Then she continued blandly: 'You must learn, my dear, to
enter this great field in a manner beneficial to yourself and the
race. You must teach others to render to C&aelig;sar what is C&aelig;sar's,
and to do this you must first render unto C&aelig;sar yourself. Do
you understand?' I looked puzzled for a moment. Then she
said: 'Twenty-five dollars, please, dear, and be sure to come
promptly at ten o'clock to-morrow. You are now admitted to the
Primary Plane, the first degree of Neministic Healing.' As I gave
her the California gold, she bowed me out of the room with a tender
and motherly smile, while she tested the unfamiliar coins by
ringing them softly on the table.</p>

<p>"At the second lesson she gave me the fundamental principles
of Neministic Healing. I received them eagerly, for I recognized
in them a close harmony with the teachings of our dear old Mr.
Dean:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"'God is the principle of Mentiphysics. As there is but one
God, there can be but one Principle in this Science. As there are
many stars, there must be many fixed rules for the demonstration
of this Divine Principle.</p>

<p>"'The fundamental propositions among these rules are proved
by inversion, for this is the basis of all true mathematics. Two
times two is four, therefore four is two times two. As a star is
the same whether seen from the north, south, east, or west, so a
precept of Mentiphysics must be the same as seen from every side.
To invert is not to change its meaning, and must prove its truth.'
Then she gave me a printed card containing these words, over
which I was to ponder until the next lesson:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. There is no Pain in Truth, therefore there is no
Truth in Pain. There is no Nerve in Mind, therefore there is no
Mind in Nerve. There is no Matter in Mind, therefore there is
no Mind in Matter. There is no Matter in Life, therefore there
is no Life in Matter. There is no Matter in Good, therefore there
is no Good in Matter. <i>Nihil nocet nemini; nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"'Twenty-five dollars, please,' and I returned to my hotel filled
with new thoughts, which I found later were very incomplete.</p>

<p>"The next day she said:</p>

<p>"'Man, my dear, is governed by Soul, not sense. Sense is the
reflection of matter, and matter does not exist. Thus sense is but
the shadow of a dream. In dreams the laws of health are valueless.
There is but one Law of Health, and that is the one precept
of Neministic Healing.</p>

<p>"'To the awakened mind the seasons will come and go, with
changes of time and tide, cold and heat, latitude and longitude.
The agriculturist finds that these changes can not affect his crops.
The mariner will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great
deep, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air. The astronomer
will no longer look up to the stars. He will look out
from them upon the universe, and the florist will find his flower
before he beholds its seed. Thus matter will be finally proved to
be nothing but a mortal belief, wholly inadequate to affect man
through its supposed organic action or existence.'</p>

<p>"Then she gave me another mystic card, which read:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. We tread on forces. Withdraw them, and Creation
must collapse. <i>Nihil nocet nemini.</i>' And this time I did
not need to be reminded of the final ceremony with which the lesson
ended. Nor did she need to clink the coins on the table.</p>

<p>"In the fourth lesson the president discoursed more fully on
'the popular gods, Sin, Sorrow, and Sickness, the three S's of
Satan; all three illusions of the Sinful Soul. The very word Illusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
proves their nothingness. These are but troubled dreams of
the darkened soul, and to rise above them is to wake from a cataleptic
nightmare to see the stars shining on the hills.</p>

<p>"'When troubled by a horrible dream, my dear, one has only
to say, "This is a Dream; I will awaken." Then the stars will
shine through the open window and the hideous vision will disappear.</p>

<p>"'So in afflictions of disease and dread and death, one must
say, "This is a Dream." Then it becomes a dream, and we rise
above it into an atmosphere of Perfect Serenity.</p>

<p>"'To the material sense, dear,' continued the president, 'to
cut the jugular vein takes away life. But in Neministic Science
Life goes on unchanged, mounting ever and ever to higher reaches,
because there is no jugular vein, and Matter can not make its mark
on Mind.</p>

<p>"'The Barometer, that little prophet of storm and sunshine,
can not be deceived by testimony of the senses. It points to fair
weather in the midst of the unreal apparition of murky clouds and
threatening rain. Thus does Neministic Science, the perfect culmination
of Mentiphysics, point to the changeless Health and Happiness
of the Enlightened Man whatever material science may have
to say about the condition of his members. Man is made in the
image of perfection, therefore failure and imperfection can never
assail him. As well expect to gather peaches from a pine tree as
to gather discord from the Concord of Being.'</p>

<p>"Then she gave me a card:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. The Equipollence of the Stars above and of the
Mind below shows the awful unreality of Evil. <i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"After the usual parting ceremony I returned to my room,
well convinced of the unreality of Boston, and doubting whether
I should ever again find my own Alcalde. I feared lest some further
precept might arise by which Alcalde could not exist.</p>

<p>"In the fifth lesson the president informed me that I was
now in the second degree, or Normal Plane. We were ready for
the first glimpse into the full, rounded perfection of Neministic
Healing.</p>

<p>"'To cure men of all ills whatsoever, we have only to show
them the stars. When we waken in the night, only the sight of
the stars can tell us we are awake. When we are awake all dreams
must vanish, and all is dream which breaks the serenity of the
mind or checks the perfect perspicacity of being. We need not
deal with the body, for the body does not exist. It is dull, heavy,
and aching, because it is the dead Residuum of Dream. When
we forget it, it is no longer there. Then and not till then can you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
smile the serene smile of the Neministically Healed and Mentiphysically
Perfect Soul.'</p>

<p>"The little card read:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. The body says, "I am ill." The reports of Sickness
may form a coalition with the reports of Sin and say, "I am
Malice, Lust, Appetite, Envy, Hate." Treat a belief in sickness
as you would sin&mdash;with sudden dismissal. If it were not for what
the human mind says of the body, the body would not be weary
any more than an inanimate wheel. <i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"On the sixth day the president greeted me with her serenest
smile.</p>

<p>"'We have now reached the point, my dear,' she said, 'when
we must abandon Pharmaceutics and take up Ontology, the science
of Abstract Being. In this we have many rivals who echo the
cry, "Why art thou, NEMINISM, come hither to torment us before
our time?" Among the systems that thus cry out are many
whom this world deems successful. Animal Magnetism, Atheism,
Spiritualism, Theosophy, Agnosticism, Pantheism, and Infidelity
are antagonistic to Mentiphysics and fatal to the demonstration
thereof, and of Neminism, its noblest culmination; and so,' she
continued, 'are some other systems.'</p>

<p>"She warned me especially against Pantheism, 'the worship
of the sylvan god Pan,' a cult reputed to be especially rife among
the members of our club at Alcalde.</p>

<p>"I tried to explain to her the difference between Pantheism
and Sciosophy, but I did not succeed very well, for she grew impatient.
In her judgment, I discovered, Sciosophy was grossly impractical,
and the views of Mr. Abner Dean would take the bread
from the mouths of better men than he. 'I am told,' she said,
'that Mr. Dean actually signed that wicked paper<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of those Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
soreheads, who call themselves the Reformed College of
Neminism.' With this, she would not listen to another word
about Sciosophy.</p>

<p>"Then I regretted that I had said anything, for this pleasant
lesson came to an abrupt end, and left me without even the customary
card to ponder over. I still wondered what could be the
secret meaning of N. N. N., <i>nihil nemini nocet</i>.</p>

<p>"On the next day the storm had blown over, or rather, like
all other storms, it had no real existence, and the smile of the
president at the closing act of the lesson was the sweetest
I had ever seen, the most perfect witness to the truth of her
teachings.</p>

<p>"She took up the subject of Materia Medica. After reading
from a printed book the names of a host of poisons, from Abacus
to Swamproot and Sandalwood and <i>Zygadene</i>, she warned us
against them all. All are alike evil. All alike have no real existence.
Therefore the student will do well not to learn their
names. It will only interfere with his serenity of mind, and perfect
serenity is the sole symptom of success.</p>

<p>"'Surely this is better,' she said, 'than to support the popular
systems of medicine, when the physician may be perchance an
infidel and lose ninety-and-nine patients where Neminism cures
its hundred. Is it because Osteopathy and Ostariopathy are more
fashionable and less spiritual? Even business men have found
that Neministic Science enhances their physical and mental powers,
enlarges their perception of character, gives them acuteness and
comprehensiveness, and an ability to exceed their ordinary business
capacity.'</p>

<p>"Then she gave me this card:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. In 1866 this discovery was made by me and by
me alone: "The erring Mortal misnamed Mind produces all the
organism and action of the mortal body." This led to the demonstration
that Mind is All and matter is naught, and being nothing,
nothing hurts nobody. Nobody hurts nothing, which proves it
plainly by inversion. <i>Nihil nocet nemini; nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"On the eighth day the president discoursed on Anatomy. Referring
briefly to the pernicious notions of the 'ancients,' as with
a broad sweep of her hand she designated the professors in Boston
and Cambridge, concerning the structure of the human body,
she called it the nightmare of undigested learning. 'Why should
we care where the jugular vein goes, when we know that there is
no jugular vein? What of bones and muscles, and teguments and
integuments? "Toil fatigues me," you say; but what is this me?
Is it muscle or Mind? Which is tired, and so speaks? Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Mind could the muscles be tired? Do the muscles talk, or do you
talk for them? Science includes no rule of discord, but governs
harmoniously.'</p>

<p>"On the card were these words:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. Flesh is an error of physical belief; a supposition
that life, substance, and intelligence are in matter; an illusion; a
belief that matter has sensations. <i>Nihil nocet nemini.</i>'</p>

<p>"On the ninth day I was admitted to the third degree, or the
Introspective Plane. As the president entered, I noticed a touch
of camellia powder on her face, for the subject of the day was
Beauty. 'Beauty,' she said, 'is internal before it is perceived outwardly.
To have perfect faith in the principle of Neminism is to
regain the charms of Eternal Youth.' She told me of patients
of hers who had become beautiful through faith. One good lady
at ninety developed new teeth through belief in Neminism&mdash;incisors,
cuspids, bicuspids, and one molar. A gentleman at sixty
had retained his full set of upper and lower teeth without a decaying
cavity.</p>

<p>"On her card were these words:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. The receipt for Beauty is to have less Illusion
and more Soul. <i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"And, as the final ceremony was passed, the president looked
almost beautiful herself.</p>

<p>"On the tenth day the president gave some account of her
early studies and of the origin of Neministic Healing.</p>

<p>"'While from the human standpoint I inherited the refinement
that goes with culture of family and moral rectitude, as
usual here in Boston, yet there was a marked degree of spiritual
Grace, Soulful Delicacy, and Esoteric Elegance that comes not from
human ancestry, neither from communion with Nature. It was
the exquisite coloring of the touch of the astral hand which opens
the petals of thought as it does the opening rose. This ended in a
soft glow of ineffable Joy, and out of its perfect serenity Neministic
Science was born.</p>

<p>"'The discovery was so new, the basis laid down for physical
and moral health so hopelessly original and men so unfamiliar with
the subject, that not until later did I venture to proclaim it to
the world.'</p>

<p>"On the card was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'N. N. N.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"'My world has sprung from Spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i8">In Everlasting Day;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Whereof I've much to glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Wherefor have much to pay.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"Under this was a picture of the egg of a vulture, in which,
through his microscope, Agassiz once saw the sun, moon, stars, and
the gathering of clouds. '<i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"At the eleventh lesson I was directed to go out for clinical
practice. In my hotel I found a dear little six-year-old boy who
had been invited, with the rest of a kindergarten class, to attend
a picnic.</p>

<p>"He did not feel that he wanted to go. He seemed dumpish,
and, according to mortal belief, was not well. At noon he said
that he wanted to go to sleep. I took him in my lap and began
to read to him from Neministic Science and Astral Health with
a Key to the Stars. Very soon he expressed a wish to go to the
picnic, and did go. So I gave him a little card, with the words
'<i>Nihil nemini nocet</i>,' and all day he said nothing more about
being sick.</p>

<p>"Next morning the president gave me an account of various
wonderful cures in her experience. Among others, she showed
me a letter from John B. Higgins, of Little Egg Harbor, N. J.
This I copied down as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I am glad to tell you how I was healed. Beliefs of consumption,
dyspepsia, neuralgia, ulcers, tobacco, and bad language....
Doctors that were consulted did nothing to relieve me, and
I constantly grew worse. Nearly two years ago you told me that
if I would read a book called Neministic Science and Astral Health
with a Key to the Stars, I would be healed. I told you I would
go into it for all it was worth, and I found that it is worth all. I
got the book and read day and night. I saw that it must be true,
and believed that what I could not then understand would be made
clear later. After some days' reading I was afflicted with drowsiness,
followed by vomiting. This lasted several hours, when I
fell into a sleep. I awoke healed.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The president assured me that if I would spend no time in
intellectual drifting, adhering to the impersonal and scientific deductions
of the one discoverer to whose clarified spiritual eye all
truth of the mind had been revealed, with all the loyalty of a
mathematician to the principles of mathematics, I would be sure
of a comfortable fortune. Although money had no real existence,
the shadow in its substance proved that there was after all
substance in its shadow. The Neministic Healer is at no expense
for books or instruments or medicine, providing always that the
one perfect Key to the Stars (including Neministic Science and
Astral Health) lies open before him. With that in sight he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
not go wrong, and with perfect faith in the unreality of all external
things it matters not in earthly affairs what he does or
leaves undone.</p>

<p>"The card for this lesson was:</p>

<p>"'N. N. N. The population of our cities is ample to supply
many practitioners, teachers, and preachers with work. To enter
this field of labor beneficially to ourselves, it is necessary to demonstrate
that <i>the patient who is able to pay for being healed is more apt
to recover</i> than he who withholds a slight equivalent for health!
<i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>'</p>

<p>"At the last lesson the president informed me that my course
of instruction was complete, and that I must now go forth and
bless the world. I must lean no longer on her personal leadership,
but, trusting in the spirit, I should rest solely on the pure
Mentiphysical principle at work. As a pioneer of Neministic Healing
in the far uncultured West, I must stand alone in the conflict,
smiting error with the falchion of Truth. The rare bequests
of the spirit are costly, and they have won fields of battle from
which the dainty borrower would have fled.'</p>

<p>"I spoke once or twice of my diploma, without which I could
not practice my profession under the laws of Fresno County. At
first she made as if she did not hear me, but at last she said:</p>

<p>"'The Massachusetts University of Mentiphysics draws its
breath from me, but I yearn for retirement. No one else can
sustain this institution amid the legislation aimed at its vital purpose.
This has given me conscientious scruples about diplomas,
and, with the growing conviction that every one should build on
his own foundation, no more diplomas shall be issued from this
flourishing school.</p>

<p>"'But do not worry, dear,' she said. 'Your power is just the
same with or without diploma. You can make known the rare
bequests of the Spirit quite as well as a martyr as you could as a
physician. The faithful will stand by you. Those who believe
will always pay. Take this locket, and hang it about your neck.
It will contain the quintessence of all my teachings, and with this
in your right hand and Neministic Science and Astral Health
with a Key to the Stars in your left, you will drain the cup which
I have drained to the dregs as the discoverer and teacher of Neminism,
and without tasting this cup its inspiration can not be gained.'</p>

<p>"Then I took the little locket, and here it is. On one side
are the letters D. N. N. N., 'which,' she said, 'makes its holder
a doctress.' On the reverse is the face of Lydia Pinkham,
while around the margin, in fine gilt letters, is a scroll with the
motto, '<i>Nihil nemini nocet.</i>' Mr. Gridley, the learned professor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
our Alcalde school, says this means 'nothing hurts nobody.' But
I am sure that there is more in it than that; besides, whatever
it is we can prove it by inversion: <i>Nihil nocet nemini; nihil nemini
nocet</i>&mdash;one is true like the other, and its symbolic significance
is proved by its three N's, for N is the symbol of eternity. At
least, this is what the president told me. But now that I am back
in Alcalde, the whole thing seems like a dream, while all the things
I had learned to call dreams seem more real than ever. Maybe
I am still on the Material Plane after all, in spite of all I have
done and all the rest of us in Alcalde are doing to try to rise
above it."</p>

<h2>DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> WALTER L. HAWLEY,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">OF THE NEW YORK EVENING SUN.</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the present century the newspapers published
in the United States numbered 200&mdash;one for each
26,450 of population&mdash;while at the present time the total of regular
publications slightly exceeds 20,000&mdash;one for each 350 inhabitants
of the country; and in that growth and development of the
business is represented more of science and art, more of physical
ingenuity and mental activity, than in any other line of human
endeavor. One hundred years ago the publication of a newspaper
did not rank as a business, and the preparation of its contents
was regarded as a pastime or the indulgence of a whim, rather
than a profession. At the end of the century, journalism is the
history of the world written day by day, the chief medium of enlightenment
for the masses, the universal forum of scholar, sage,
and scientist. As a business enterprise, the newspaper of to-day
commands unlimited capital, and as a profession it ranks second
to none.</p>

</div>

<p>For three centuries and a half following Gutenberg's invention
of type little progress was made in the art of printing, and
the production of a newspaper in this country in 1800 was accomplished
with crude machinery and involved much slow and difficult
hand labor. The printing was done on wooden presses of
primitive pattern, the type was large and ill formed, the paper
used was in many cases inferior to the lowest grade made at the
present time, and the production of a large number of copies of
any issue was out of the question. No attempt was made in this
country to publish a daily paper until 1784, and in 1800 daily editions
were issued only in four or five of the larger cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">From the New York Gazette and General Advertiser of January 1, 1800.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The publications of that
period were not newspapers
in the sense in which
the word is now used, because
no particular effort
was made to present an account
of the happenings of
the day. Notices of the
arrival and departure of
ships, time tables of mail
coaches, and brief announcements
of matters
of political interest filled
the limited space devoted
to domestic news. Foreign
news consisted entirely of
matter reprinted from the
English journals received
by sailing vessels, and
therefore weeks or months
old when it appeared. The
wooden presses used a hundred
years ago were operated
entirely by hand.
After the type had been set
it was placed in a frame or
"form," with little or no
regard to artistic arrangement
of headlines or displayed
matter. To print
the edition, the "form"
was placed on the bed of
the press and ink spread
over the type by the use of
hand rollers. The white
paper was then dampened
with water, sheet by sheet,
laid over the stationary
"form," and the impression
was made by pulling
down the upper part of the
press with a lever. This
work was so slow that a
circulation of three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
hundred copies of a daily
newspaper would severely
tax the capacity of the
press room. The weekly
publications were as a rule
limited to about the same
figures, because the entire
mechanical part of production
devolved upon one
man, who was often owner
and editor as well as
printer. Some iron presses
were imported from England
in 1810, and in 1817
George Clymer, of Philadelphia,
invented a lever
press that was a marked
improvement over the
crude machines then in
general use, reducing the
manual labor required and
increasing the speed with
which printed papers could
be turned out. The first
power press used in this
country was invented by
Daniel Treadwell, of Boston,
in 1822, and operated
by the American
Bible Society, the power
being furnished by a team
of mules. These presses
were not adapted to newspaper
work, and the first
considerable advance in
the mechanical part of the
business was made in 1829
and 1830, when a Washington
hand press was invented.
Seventeen years
later a cylinder power
press was perfected by
Richard M. Hoe, and the
mechanical ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
produce periodicals was more than doubled; but during the time
when American ingenuity developed the steam engine, the cotton
gin, the sewing machine,
and the electric
telegraph, the progress
made in the mechanism
of newspaper making
was comparatively insignificant.
The process
of stereotyping was
introduced into this
country from England
in 1813, and a year
later the New Testament
was printed from
plates, but the discovery
was not utilized in
the publication of newspapers
until 1861.</p>

<p>In the first half of
the century journalism
did not at any time
rank as a profession requiring
special training,
and capacity, and the
returns of the counting
room were so meager,
the cost of material so
high, and the appliances
in the mechanical department
so imperfect,
that the publication of
newspapers rose only
by slow degrees to recognition
as a business
enterprise in which capital
might seek investment
with fair prospect
of a satisfactory return.
Modeled after English
publications, the early
American newspapers
depended, for whatever
of reputation or success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
they achieved, upon the fame and ability of the editor. The reporting
of current events without comment was a secondary feature
of the daily papers, and in the weekly publications it was not
attempted. Before the days of railroads and prompt and reliable
mail service, communication between men in public life and, in
fact, all persons of education, was chiefly by letter. The custom
grew into a fixed habit, and to a large extent influenced the character
of the newspapers published prior to 1850. The editor addressed
himself directly to his readers through long editorials upon
topics in which he was interested, and his publication was in reality
a mere instrument for
the expression of opinions.
Public men and
politicians were encouraged
to write letters for
publication upon public
questions, and a long
communication from a
man of national reputation
was regarded by the
editor as matter of far
more value to his journal
than any amount of news
of the events of the day.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Municipal Notice from the New York Gazette and General Advertiser of January 1, 1800.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The organization and
development of political
parties in the early part
of the second quarter of
the century resulted in
a rapid increase in the
number of newspapers
throughout the country.
Party leaders found that they could reach a greater number of
citizens by means of published letters and speeches than by the
primitive process of campaigning by easy stages from one State
or county to another. From writing personal letters to friends
in their districts, senators and representatives in Congress found
that they could keep their constituents better informed of the
progress of legislation and politics by means of signed statements
in the press of their respective States. The party organ and the
personal journal were the immediate natural results of this condition
of public life and politics. Every secular journal supported
some political party or organization without qualification,
and there was little or no independence of the press. The editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
found his subscribers among the members of his own party, and
often looked to the organization or the candidate for financial support.
Papers were established and editors hired by parties, factions,
and individual leaders to advocate some particular plan of
finance or tariff, or some general policy for the nation or State.
During this stage of American journalism the influence of a paper
depended largely upon the reputation, individuality, and force of
character of the editor. He needed not to possess any particular
qualification for the work, except a general knowledge of the
affairs on which he was to write and a command of vigorous language
to compel attention to his utterances. For many years the
majority of the periodicals of the country, daily and weekly, were
critical reviews of the events of the time, rather than mediums
for the spread of general information. News of important happenings
at home spread through all the States ahead of the circulation
of the papers, and the people looked to the latter for review
and comment upon events, rather than for detailed accounts
of the occurrences. Foreign affairs, as reported in the English
publications received in this country, took precedence in the classification
of news in the journals of the first half of the century, and
local events, often matters that were subsequently recognized as
of great historical value, were briefly and too often imperfectly
recorded. It is a matter to be regretted that in the days when
American statesmen and orators were making history for the world,
when the new republic, having passed beyond the stage of experiment,
was advancing with prodigious strides toward glorious
achievements in material development, the journals of the country
kept but an imperfect and often inaccurate record of events
that should have been reported in full.</p>

<p>During the first forty years of the present century there was
no system of collecting the news for publication, and the capital
invested in the newspaper business was insufficient to permit of
any extra outlay to obtain reports of events occurring at a distance
in advance of the regular mails. Such reports as were obtained
were usually voluntary contributions written by a friend
of the editor, and often colored or distorted according to the prejudice
of the writer. These letters were, almost without exception,
semi-editorial in character, the writers indulging freely in comment
and expression of opinion upon the event they attempted to record,
so that no political or public matter was reported entirely free
from partisan coloring. The drivers of mail coaches, the captains
of coastwise or river vessels, strolling peddlers, lawyers, surveyors,
and wandering missionaries, who made long journeys into the interior
and from town to town, were the news reporters of early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
days. When they arrived in a city or town they would tell the
latest news from the places they had visited, and the next issue
of the local paper would contain a story beginning, "The Rev.
Mr. Bland, the traveling missionary, relates," etc., or, "Captain
Smith, of the schooner&mdash;&mdash;, reports having heard," etc. Information
received in this way might relate to Indian uprisings, fires,
floods, crimes, accidents, or political events; but in every case the
published account would be interspersed with opinions of the narrator
and the comments of the editor who prepared the story for
publication. For news of events happening in the larger cities,
the journals of the first half of the century depended almost entirely
on reprinting from exchanges. They had no regular correspondents
anywhere, and a paper published in New York would
reprint from the papers of Boston and Philadelphia such of the
news of those cities as impressed the editor as being of more than
local interest. During the War of 1812, the subsequent Indian
wars, and the conflict with Mexico, news of battles and movements
of armies in the field was obtained by the slow process of waiting
for official reports to the Government or private letters from officers
and men at the front. The Mexican War stimulated the public
demand for news, increased the circulation of newspapers, and
did more than any other event up to that time to arouse the
editors of the country to the fact that the people wanted early
and complete information of what was going on in the world,
rather than individual opinions on general problems. While
that struggle was in progress the arrival of the weekly mail in
a remote village was an event of importance. The inhabitants
would gather in large numbers at the post office, and the meager
war news contained in the newspapers would be read aloud.
The postmaster or some subscriber to a paper would often post
a copy of the latest journal in some conspicuous place in the
town, and from that simple beginning there was developed the
newspaper bulletin board, where the public may obtain brief
information of great events before the full report can be put
in type.</p>

<p>After the division of the voters of the country into organized
political parties, the tariff, banking and currency, the acquisition
of additional territory, and States rights developed into great national
questions, precipitating prolonged and heated discussion by
the statesmen of that period. This condition stimulated the
growth of a certain class of newspapers, and brought into prominence
many writers of ability. The statesmen and politicians of
that time turned to the press as an available and valuable medium
through which to disseminate arguments. They sought to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
rather than to inform the public, and the journalism of that
period made no substantial progress except as an instrument for
the development and exploitation of writers of force and influence.
Whatever power
the press exerted in shaping
events, whatever it
accomplished in swaying
the public mind in the
days when nullification
was scotched and territorial
expansion was accepted
as a fixed policy of
the majority, should be
credited to the genius and
individuality of the leading
writers of that time,
rather than to a full presentation
of facts. The
years of agitation of the
question of slavery still
further developed individuality
in journalism. The
newspaper became an instrument
for educating
the people on certain public
questions, and an influence
upon public opinion
by means of editorial writing.
That was the period
of so-called great editors,
of whom Horace Greeley
may be mentioned as a
conspicuous example, who
made and unmade politicians
with their praise
or criticism, who shaped
the policy of political
parties, controlled conventions
and nominated candidates,
changed the current
of their country's history
at critical points, and in many ways wielded an influence in
public affairs greater than that of the leading statesmen. The
editor of that time was greater than his newspaper, and the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of the press was in reality the force of character of the individual
exerted through the instrument within his control.</p>

<p>From 1830 to 1860 the progress made in the mechanical department
of the business
was slow and unimportant
in comparison with
recent inventions. Cylinder
presses came into general
use for the printing
of daily papers, but the
weekly and monthly publications
continued to use
the primitive hand machines.
The speed of press-work
was still limited to
a few hundred copies per
hour, so that an extensive
circulation could not be
supplied even if there had
been a demand for it. The
white paper used was still
made entirely of rags, and
most of the material was
imported from Austria and
Italy. The cost of production
was high, and few
newspapers in the United
States were published at a
fair profit. The uncertainty
of the financial returns
from the business
greatly retarded its development.
Inventors found
that their ingenuity would
receive more substantial
rewards in other fields, and
editors and publishers were
rarely practical men who
could discover imperfections
in mechanism and
suggest improvements in
their own shops. Throughout
the first half of the
century most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
improved methods of printing were developed in the establishments
of book and job printers. There new presses and all new mechanical
devices were first installed, and the newspaper followed,
instead of leading, in the work of material progress in the art.</p>

<p>To the New York Herald is generally credited the departure
from old-time methods that resulted in the creation of newspapers
devoted entirely to the publication of news, the reporting of the
happenings of the world day by day. The innovation was not
well received by the editors, who believed that the public cared
more for opinions than a record of events. The new method
proved popular, however,
and the development of the
newspaper from the personal
journal and party organ
dates from that time.
The founder of the Herald
and the new school of journalism
spent money to obtain
the news of the world
ahead of the ordinary channels
of communication. He
established a system of special
couriers, employed correspondents,
and made the
collection of reports of
events of general interest a
matter of first importance
in the business of making a
newspaper. Other editors
followed the new movement
slowly, and often with much doubt and hesitation, but those who
stood still and refused to supply their readers with the news were
in time compelled to go out of the business.</p>

</div>

<p>When the civil war began the new order of journalism had progressed
far enough to create a general demand for a full report
of the progress of that great conflict. All the larger cities of the
country were connected by railroads and telegraph lines, the political
agitation for five years prior to the beginning of hostilities had
aroused the people to a feeling of intense interest in the struggle,
the circulation of the daily papers had increased almost to the
limit of their mechanical capacity, and every condition favored
a rapid development of the business with a certainty of profitable
returns. The leading editors of the country still exerted a far-reaching
influence in public affairs, and they were consulted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the highest officers of the Government; but the time had come
when the people wanted the news, rather than individual opinions.
American genius and ingenuity responded promptly and adequately
to the demand, and from the time of the civil war the development
of the newspaper has been a marvel of science and art. The
telegraph came into general use for the transmission of news,
correspondents and artists were sent to the front with all the
armies, the men employed in Washington to write their own views
of public questions were instructed to send to their papers only
a record of the great events then transpiring around them, and in
a month, or at most a year, American journalism was well advanced
upon a new era of marvelous development. The time
when the opinions, the power in phraseology, or the individuality
of one man could alone make a daily newspaper a financial, literary,
or political success had passed. The press had become an
institution, journalism a profession, and the publication of newspapers
a practical business requiring and rewarding enterprise and
sagacity.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 333px;">

<p>With the sudden demand for more papers came rapid progress
in the mechanical department of the business. Double cylinder
presses capable of printing twenty thousand papers an hour were
soon perfected, folding machines came into general use, stereotyping
was employed to save time, labor, and wear of type, white
paper was made from wood pulp at greatly reduced cost, and the
progress in all departments of the business was by leaps and bounds
until every demand was more than supplied and new expectations
created. From that time forward invention kept pace with every
increase of circulation. As soon as one press was found inadequate
or imperfect, the manufacturers were ready to set up a
faster and better one. As competition reduced the selling price
of the newspaper, invention supplied every demand for the material
of production at a reduced rate. The impetus to circulation
imparted by the civil war created a new reading public, which rapidly
grew to include every person who could read and a demand
for all the news of the world once created would not be denied.
The collection of news was quickly reduced to a system and perfected,
until to-day no event of importance occurring in any part
of the world is omitted from the daily record of current history.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bookseller's Advertisement from the New York Evening Post of Friday, December 11, 1801.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The great cost of collecting news at the front and transmitting
by telegraph full reports of battles during the civil war caused
certain newspapers in New York city to enter into an arrangement
to receive reports in duplicate and share expenses. Then
the cost was further reduced by selling the news to papers in other
cities. That was the beginning of the Associated Press, a plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of newspaper combination that ultimately made the buying and
selling of news a great commercial enterprise. Within a few years
after the close of the war this system had been developed until
practically all the daily newspapers of the country were interested
in it or subscribers to the news collected and sold. This
feature of the business continued to grow until agencies for the
collection and transmission of news were established throughout
the world. Similar associations were formed in England and on
the continent of Europe, and news exchanged with the American
organization. In the United States the business was developed
until newspapers of particular sections of the country and even
those of single States formed associations on the principle of mutual
benefit for the collection of full reports of all important events
within the territory where they circulated. At the present time
the system has been perfected until the great news agencies of the
country receive reports of important events from every quarter of
the globe with a degree of promptness and accuracy rendered possible
only by thoroughness of organization and the constant exercise
of the keenest intelligence. The collection of all the news
of the world would not be possible under any other plan, but the
American newspapers, having created a demand for the news, were
the first to devise a system of obtaining it promptly at a cost that
made possible the publication of daily papers at a profit in almost
every town in the country. Brief reports of all important events
are transmitted by cable or telegraph to a central office in New
York, Washington, or Chicago, where they are condensed or elaborated,
as occasion may require, and then sent out over special telegraph
wires to papers all over the country that are subscribers to
the service. The larger papers of the country, however, do not
rely upon this service alone. They are represented by special
correspondents not only in all the chief cities of the United States,
but in London. Paris, Berlin, and other news centers of the Old
World.</p>

<p>The development of the newspaper into a medium for recording
day by day every event of human interest was so rapid during
the civil war and the stirring times immediately thereafter that
many faults of form and detail remained. The journalism of that
period was a new departure, and the men who created it had no
precedent to guide them, but all the time there was a steady and
intelligent effort to improve in all directions. The efforts of the
leading men in the profession, influenced by conditions and surroundings,
resulted in the creation of what were for a time known
as schools of journalism&mdash;that is, one man set up an ideal, and
another man strived to create a journal of another character. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>aim of all was to publish the general news of the day, but political
influences were still strong enough to control editorial policy,
and ultra-partisan and sectional views were incorporated in the
record of events. There were still editors of great power and
influence in politics and public affairs, and they tried to shape
the current of the new condition by the force of editorial writing.
A number of editors, of both the old and new order, for a time
followed the policy of subordinating to partisan politics all other
features of the newspaper. They sought to make the press the
dominant influence in politics, and to do that they presented in
their journals only one side of public and party questions. They
undertook to think and to reason for their readers, and their partisan
and sectional views were reflected in the news columns of
their papers. So long as party feeling ran high this style of journalism
was popular and successful, but the newspaper, being in
the nature of an educator of the masses, soon set the people to
thinking for themselves, and created a demand for the news of
public and political events without the color of individual opinion.
The change from intense partisanship to partial or complete independence
of editorial utterance has come slowly, and is still under
way. To-day there is no great daily newspaper in the United
States so entirely subservient to a political party as to support any
man or measure without question or protest. Politicians fear this
spirit of independence, and therein lies the secret of the great
power of the press in public affairs. The most powerful and successful
journals are those that combine absolute fairness and honesty
with independence.</p>

<p>So-called schools of journalism, in the rapid development of
the profession during the past twenty years, have merged into one
general system or plan, which is to get all the news and publish it.
Journals may be graded or classified by their treatment of news
and their judgment as to the intelligence and moral character of
the reading public.</p>

<p>A detailed record of the development of the mechanical part
of the newspaper business during the past thirty years would be
almost a synopsis of all progress in science and art. The newspaper
printing press of to-day, which prints, cuts, folds, and counts
ninety-six thousand papers per hour, with one man to operate it,
is the mechanical wonder of the age. It is justly regarded as the
greatest piece of machinery that the ingenuity of man has yet
devised. Type is no longer set by hand in the making of a newspaper,
the letters being formed from the metal direct and cast in
finished lines by machinery.</p>

<p>Studying the perfection and magnitude of the newspaper printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
press of to-day it is difficult to realize that little more than
half a century of time and invention stand between this piece of
mechanism, that seems to work with human intelligence, and the
Washington hand press, upon which the production of printed
sheets was a matter of slow and arduous labor. The great metropolitan
newspapers of to-day are printed by monster machines
weighing thirty tons, composed of four thousand separate pieces
of steel, iron, brass, wood, and cloth. In the great printing-press
factory of R. Hoe &amp; Co. eighteen months' time is required to
build one of the modern presses, and the cost of it would have more
than paid for all the newspaper printing presses in use in the
United States at the beginning of the century. These monster
machines are known as quadruple presses, which means that four
complete presses have been built into one. When in operation,
white paper is fed to them automatically from rolls, and this paper,
with a speed greater than the eye can follow, is converted into
the finished newspaper, printed on both sides, cut into sheets, pasted
together, folded, counted, and deposited in files of fifty or one
hundred at one side of the press. White paper is fed to the press
from two points, and finished newspapers are delivered at two
places on the opposite side. An idea of the speed with which the
work is done may be gained by watching the printed papers fall
from the folder. They drop so fast that the eye, no matter how
well trained, can not count them. These presses have a capacity
of ninety-six thousand four-, six-, or eight-page papers per hour,
and forty-eight thousand ten-, twelve-, or sixteen-page papers.
Their mechanism is so perfect and so carefully adjusted that the
breaking of a narrow band of tape in the folder, the loosening of
a nut, the slightest bending of a rod, friction in a bearing, or any
other derangement, no matter how slight, is instantly apparent to
the skilled machinist in charge.</p>

<p>The white paper used in making the newspapers of to-day is
manufactured from wood pulp and is put up in long rolls, wound
about an iron cylinder that can be adjusted in place at one end
of the press. These rolls contain from two to four miles of paper,
and weigh from eight hundred to twelve hundred pounds each.
As soon as one roll is used up another is lifted into place, the loose
ends of the two are pasted together, and, after a stop of less than
two minutes, the great press is again belching forth finished newspapers
at the rate of sixteen hundred a minute, or two hundred and
sixty-six each second.</p>

<p>Almost every invention and device of recent years in connection
with the use of electricity is in some way utilized in the production
and distribution of the daily newspapers. The evolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
of journalism having finally established the fact that the chief
function of the daily newspaper is to publish the news of the world,
the problem of the business is how to obtain the news surely, accurately,
and promptly. The ocean cable has taken the place of the
sailing vessel, the trained correspondent has succeeded the occasional
contributor, the electric telegraph and telephone have entirely
superseded the mail in the transmission of domestic news,
and every event of human interest throughout the civilized world
is placed before millions of readers within a few hours of its actual
occurrence.</p>

<p>The collection of news is not restricted by any question of the
cost of obtaining it. Fifty years ago it was considered a remarkable
feat for one newspaper to obtain information of an important
event in advance of competitors. To-day it is a matter of
comment if any newspaper fails to publish all the news desired by
its readers. If a war is fought on any part of the earth there are
reporters on the firing line, and no expense is spared in collecting
and transmitting by the quickest method available full reports of
any event of world-wide importance. To-day the hiring of special
trains, the stringing of a special line of telegraph wire, the
charter of a ship, the fitting out of an exploring expedition, or any
other great enterprise in the way of collecting information for the
newspapers of the United States, is so much a part of the everyday
business of journalism that such things are accepted as a matter
of course, or cause no more than a passing comment.</p>

<p>Half a century ago the result of a national convention or election
was not known all over the country for weeks afterward. In
the case of a national convention to-day, telegraph wires lead from
the convention hall into the offices of all the newspapers in the
larger cities. An operator sits near the platform of the presiding
officer, and with a muffled key he sends over the wire a full report
of the proceedings, with a description of every incident of
interest. At the other end of the line is an operator at a typecasting
machine receiving the report and putting it into lines as
fast as received. When a candidate for President has been nominated,
extra editions of the daily papers are selling on the streets
of cities a thousand miles away almost before the applause for the
winning man has died out in the convention hall. The people of
every city and town in the United States where a newspaper is
published would feel themselves cheated of their rights if they
failed to receive news of the result of an election by midnight of
the day on which the ballots were cast.</p>

<p>In enterprise and originality the journalism of America leads
the world at the end of the nineteenth century. As a profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
it commands, with alluring prospects of fame and fortune, the
services of men of genius and learning. Those who enter it from
choice succeed or fail quickly. It is a life of activity, a work where
energy and intelligence are essential qualifications, and honor and
honesty are certain of reward. There is no enduring place in the
profession for hypocrisy, indolence, or mediocrity.</p>

<h2>VALUE OF THE STUDY OF ART.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> GEORGES PERROT.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Georges Perrot is one of the leading art writers and teachers of France. Born in
1832, not far from Paris, he was graduated from the &Eacute;cole Normale about 1855, and was
then for three years at the French School at Athens. From his return to the present day
he has occupied, with honor and distinction, many positions in the world of letters. At
present he is a member of the Institut, an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur, a professor &agrave; la
Facult&eacute; des Lettres de Paris, and the director of the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. He is best
known to scholars outside of France by the magnificent work on the History of Art in Antiquity,
which he is writing, assisted by Charles Chipiez, architecte du gouvernement, and of
which seven superb quartos have already appeared. (Hachette et Cie.) In 1891, by a decree
of the Minister of Public Instruction, the study of the history of the fine arts was introduced
into a section of the studies pursued at the lyc&eacute;es. In an article in the Revue des
Deux Mondes, July 15, 1899, Perrot pleads for an increase of the time assigned to the study
and for its introduction into other parts of the curriculum.</p>

<p>I have translated those pages of the article which are of general interest as a contribution
to a subject which is deservedly attracting the attention of American institutions of
learning.</p>

<p>Written and spoken language, the language of which the
signs are words, is not the only language which man uses
to convey his ideas. There is also the language of forms, which,
with no less clearness and force, conveys the conceptions of the intellect
and the sentiments of the heart. We study the history and
the literature of bygone people for the purpose of acquiring a
better knowledge of ourselves, and this knowledge is secured by
becoming conscious of the different states of mind, to use a modern
expression, through which our ancestors have passed. Even the
most elementary and the most remote of these successive conditions
are, unconsciously perhaps, represented in the depths of our
being by beliefs and customs for which the present order and progress
of civilization can not account.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>Not to go back to the Quaternary period or to the cave dwellers,
there are many of these mental ideas or conditions which would
remain hidden from the inquiry of the historian if he were limited
to written testimony. One example may suffice: the discoveries
of Schliemann, at Troy, Mycen&aelig;, and Tiryns have rescued from oblivion
a primitive Greece of which the Greeks themselves had preserved
but a faint remembrance. Thus has been given to the
Homeric epoch a background of many centuries. Now this Greece,
contemporary of the Thutmoses and the Ramses of Egypt, anterior
to not only Grecian history but even to Grecian tradition, could
not write, but could work and use stone; could hew wood and fashion
it for carpentry; could mold and bake clay; could melt and
hammer lead, bronze, gold, and silver; and could carve ivory.
Every bit of material fashioned by the instruments of this period
has the value of an authentic document. How society was constituted,
the life that was led, what notions were held of the hereafter&mdash;all
these things are revealed by the marks the hands of man have
left upon everything he touched. The colossal walls of Tiryns,
the majestic funeral cupolas of Mycen&aelig;, the divisions of the royal
abodes of which the outlines can still be traced on the surface of
the soil, and the arrangement of the sepulchres hidden beneath it
all testify. So, too, the weapons, the instruments, the vases, and
the jewels which have been found scattered about amid the ruins
of the buildings or buried in the tombs. Thanks to all these monuments,
we are beginning to recognize in a shadow which year by
year glows with a brighter light the features which characterized
the world of Ach&aelig;an heroes of which the image, transformed by
oral tradition and singularly enlarged by power of invention, is reflected
in the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p>

<p>From these obscure and remote ages let us transport ourselves
to the Greece of Pisistratus, of Pericles, and of Alexander. Instructors
of youth tell of the losses which have been made, and of
how small a part of the literary work of Greek genius has escaped
the great shipwreck of antiquity. Should they not also indicate
where precious supplements of information may be found to fill the
voids of written tradition? There are many variations of important
myths, hardly mentioned in passing by obscure epitomizers of
the lower centuries, which have furnished to ceramic artists subjects
for pictures which make us acquainted with personages and with
episodes of which writers have hardly left a trace. But even if we
had the works of the cyclic poets, all of which have perished; if
we had the lyric poets, of whom only Pindar has survived, and
Bacchylides whose fragments are to-day the joy of Hellenists; if
we had the whole of tragedy, of which we have but the remnants;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
if we had all of that comedy which is represented by Aristophanes
alone; if we had all of the more ancient comedy, all of the middle
period and all of the new, with Menander who since the Renaissance
is the regret of all critics of fine apprehension&mdash;all this poetry
could not exhaust the multiple fecundity and the prodigious
richness of the imagination which created it. If malevolent Fortune
had decreed the destruction of every bit of Greek plastic art
we should have been condemned to perpetual ignorance of many
aspects and methods of the Greek soul. Is there anything in literature
worth the little clay figures of Tanagra in making clear how
the Greeks apprehended and enjoyed female beauty: how they
loved it not only in the noble and serious types of a Pallas or an
Aphrodite, but even as presented by the humble inhabitants of
little villages in the graceful <i>abandon</i> of their everyday life and
in the liberty of their most ordinary attitudes? If we base an
opinion of the religion of the Greeks only upon the epithets used
by poets in defining the gods and upon actions they attributed to
them, we run the risk of judging wrongly. In contemplating their
images we obtain clearer notions of the ideas associated with each
divine type. Alas! we do not possess the great works of Phidias
which according to men of authority made men more religious&mdash;the
Athene of the Parthenon and the Zeus of Olympia. But even
in the reduced copies of these two masterpieces which have reached
down to our time we can divine how the master expressed in the
one the idea of calm and luminous intelligence and of supreme wisdom,
and in the other the idea of that sovereign force in repose
and of that omnipotence, tempered by goodness, which were conceived
to exist in the sovereign of the universe, the father of gods
and men.</p>

<p>In subsequent paragraphs Perrot imagines the Greek statues
of the Louvre thus addressing a classical student:</p>

<p>"Young man, you who are studying Greece in Homer and
Plato, in Sophocles and Herodotus, do not pass us by so quickly.
We also belong to that Greece which you discern and which you
seek in their writings, of which not without difficulty you decipher
the prose and the verse. To understand and to love us, to read in
our features the thoughts of which we are the expression, to seize
in the modeling of our flesh and in the pure outline of our limbs
the secret of the genius which created us, no grammar nor dictionary
is needed; only apply yourself to the education of your eye.
In this exercise, in this apprenticeship, you will find a pleasure
which will become more and more keen as you become more capable
of perceiving rapidly the finest gradations. If you aspire to
become an authorized interpreter of Greek genius, do not fear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
you may be losing time. When, by long and affectionate intercourse,
you shall have sufficiently entered into our intimacy to be
able at any given hour to evoke in your spirit, as clearly as if we
stood before you, a vision of the forms which shall have become
dear to you, then the images which shall be awakened in your
memories when you read the poets will be akin to those which the
same recitals and the same epithets suggested to the Greeks who
saw us born. To them you will be drawn by similarity of impression.
You will be nearer to them, nearer to thinking and feeling
after their fashion, at least by moments, than the most subtle grammarian
or the most learned Hellenist who never has seen us."</p>

<p>Turning from Greece to Italy, Perrot derives a no less striking
lesson from the statues of Roman emperors:</p>

<p>"Is there a lesson, though given by the most learned professor,
that could cause to live before us all the life of the Rome of the
C&aelig;sars as do these effigies? In the long succession of portraits
which embrace three centuries of history the differences of times
and of men are contrasted more keenly and more vividly than in
the recitals of ancient authors or in the dissertations of modern
erudites. Augustus and Tiberius, Constantine and Theodosius, all
bore the same title&mdash;'imperator'; all were called consuls, C&aelig;sars,
Augusti, <i>patres patri&aelig;</i>, etc. Nevertheless, from the first to the
fourth centuries the supreme power was greatly modified. Volumes
have been written to explain the change, but there is nothing
that makes it so clear as the comparison of the images of these
princes. Augustus, in perhaps the most beautiful of all his statues,
called <i>de Prima Porta</i>, has his head, arms, legs, and feet bare.
Over the soldier's short tunic he wears a cuirass, and over it is
thrown the military mantle of command. He is represented as
supreme chief haranguing his troops. Another statue may represent
him as a simple citizen, clothed with the toga and holding in
his hand the manuscript of the discourse he proposes reading to
the senate. The statues still show forth the Roman Republic, at
least the customs and the style of it. Most vividly is the spirit and
also the deception of the system perceived which, while investing
a single individual with a power almost limitless, affects for two
centuries a preservation of ancient liberties. Turn from these to
an image of one of the successors of Diocletian, one who preferred
to reside in Constantinople, the new capital of the empire. Do
not seek his image in one of the ceremonial statues where, by force
of routine, the sculptor may perchance have preserved classic rules;
but in monuments of another order, where the artist kept closer
to reality, in miniatures adorning manuscripts, in mosaics, in ivory
diptychs, etc. There you will find figures which have nothing left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the simplicity and nobility which Rome borrowed from Greece,
but figures which in some particulars recall the old art of Asia,
and in others already announce the art of the middle ages. The
head is encircled with a diadem. The body and the limbs are entirely
hidden by clinging draperies which are very long and very
narrow. The materials which form this species of case are decorated
from top to bottom with rich embroideries in the shape of
medallions, flowers, animals, and even persons. There is no more
deception; we are no longer in Rome; fictions so long preserved
have finally disappeared; the empire has turned into an Oriental
despotism.</p>

<p>"Between the two extremes of the series, how many degrees
are there which furnish the very best commentaries of history?
The heads of all the C&aelig;sars, even those of Claudius, the accidental
scholar, and of Caligula, the wicked and witty fool, are aristocratic.
They show the nobility and the pride of race. You recognize in
them the descendants of those grand patrician families which at
first seemed to hold exclusively the right to give masters to the
Romans. With Vespasian, scion of a middle-class family pushing
its way into second-class public positions, the advent of a new order
is evident. Vespasian has the round and smooth, double-chinned
face of the chief clerk of a commercial or banking establishment.
Trajan has the features of a soldier who has probably pushed his
way to the front from the ranks. Hadrian, who turns his head
to hear the better, whose bright eyes gleam even in the marble,
whose half-opened mouth seems in the act of speech, shows the features
of a learned and intelligent scholar. Marcus Aurelius, with
his bristling hair and beard, would be taken for a Greek philosopher.
In Caracalla's looks there is derangement. His eye betrays
that murderous and fantastic frenzy which seized more than
one emperor, especially of those who from early youth had been
exposed to the temptations of absolute power.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>"Not to personages alone do pictured monuments give life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The same character of sensible reality is imparted to the frame and
to the surroundings of the picture, to all the theater where these actors
played their parts. Of this truth no one of our teachers, when
I was a collegian, seemed to have a suspicion. There was not an
illustration in the cold and dry compendiums which were placed in
our hands. I can almost ask myself if, when I studied Greek and
Roman history, I was really convinced that Sparta and Athens,
Rome and Carthage had actually existed. I certainly did not know
how or where to place them in space, what idea to have of their
situation, or of the outlines made by the ridges of their walls, their
houses, and their temples. All these cities were to me vague shadows,
floating between heaven and earth. No one of them answered
to a distinct and defined form.</p>

<p>"If this be the case with classical antiquity, in spite of the color
and splendor of the narratives of its writers, how much more difficult
is it to know and understand France of the middle ages when
condemned to study it in its literary work alone! The literature
of the period is partly in debased Latin, partly in early French.
The French of the day was not the language of the thinkers. The
deep thought of the age is not to be found in minstrelsy and ballads.
It must be asked of the learned, of philosophers, of theologians,
and of sacred writers. But to follow them in the subtle
analyses and in the excessive complications of symbolism, in which
they delight, requires mental efforts which are made all the more
laborious by the artificial character of the church Latin, which no
longer continued to renew itself at the source of popular speech.
It is impossible to see how such works, in spite of their value to
erudition, can be called to take part in the education of the young.
It is for this reason that lately, by a judicious innovation, a discreet
place has been made in the curriculum for histories and poems
written in the common language, for the Chanson de Roland, and
for the works of Villehardouin and Joinville. But the student
can only read these in translations, or in those adaptations which
so modernize the language as to leave but a little of its original
flavor, and which therefore make but an imperfect contact between
the original work and the mind of the reader. But supposing the
scholar capable of mastering the original text: can its formless and
superabundant prose, or the tiresome monotone of its flowing dissonances,
give him emotions which have the vivacity of those which
a page of Tacitus or a song of Virgil gives to those who know
even a modicum of Latin? Can they have the power to excite the
imagination in the same degree as any strong and concise sentence
of the historian, any sonorous and glowing verse of the Roman
poet?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is only exceptionally and as by flashes that the writings of
the middle ages give the impression of true beauty. The conceptions
are often grand, but the expression is always weak and dragging.
On the other hand, Roman or Gothic churches are not less
beautiful after their manner than Greek temples. Their beauty
is of another fashion, but many souls are touched more deeply.
They manifest no less clearly the power of the religious faith which
constructed them. The particular character of Christian faith is
shown with singular clearness in their majesty, in the elevation of
their vaults, in the half lights which flood them, and in the thousands
of figures which populate and animate every surface. As
in Greece, the sculptor co-operates intelligently and docilely with
the architect and has occupied no less happily the allotted fields.
As Phidias and Alcamenes represented on the pediments and friezes
of Doric temples the great gods of Greece and the local myths of
Athens and Olympia, so anonymous masters, called to decorate the
cathedrals of the middle ages, have placed impressive statues on
the sides and in the <i>voussoirs</i> of the portals, in the open galleries
which run along the fa&ccedil;ades, on the top of the pinnacles which
throng the roof&mdash;in fact, everywhere where space is offered. These
statues, distributed in an order regulated by doctrine and tradition,
show forth the Saviour, the Virgin, saints and angels, prophets and
apostles, and hosts of personages and scenes suggested by Holy
Writ or by local and popular legends. Among these images there
are many at Bourges, Chartres, Rheims, Amiens, and N&ocirc;tre Dame
de Paris, which are marvels of severe elegance, of chaste and
haughty grace, and of lofty moral nobility. This wonderful statuary
has but lately been investigated, exposed, and studied, but already
it would be difficult to find a connoisseur unwilling to compare
with the most boasted statues of antiquity that admirable
image of the teaching Christ of the west portal of Amiens, to
which the popular surname has been attached of <i>le Beau Dieu
d'Amiens</i>.</p>

<p>"For evident reasons, French sculpture of the thirteenth century
did not, as did Greek sculpture, devote itself to the study and
reproduction of the nude. It denied itself this attraction. All
figures are clad; but beneath the drapery, which is in fine masses
with large folds, the outline and the movement of form are indicated
with precision. The principal interest and the rare originality,
however, of this sculpture is that it is perhaps the most expressive
that has ever existed. This expressiveness appears in the
general effect of the pose, in the disposition of the drapery, but
especially in the character which the artist has succeeded in giving
to the features of the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"The august mysteries of the Christian dogma, the poetry of
the Old and of the New Testament, the triumphant deaths of martyrs,
the miracles of saints and their infinite charity&mdash;these things
which the middle ages failed to put into clear and intelligible words
are fully rendered in sculpture. The work of the chisel is large and
firm. Difficulties are not sought, nor are they feared. Whatever
be the material, the form is sure. To understand how superior
the plastic is to the literary work, and to measure the distance,
compare the Amiens statue with the portraits the authors of the
Mysteries endeavor to draw of the Son of God. 'What can be
more flat than these poor verses, which are nevertheless of the sixteenth
century? The authors had good intentions and an apprehension
of what should be done, but they were betrayed by the language
in which they wrote. The sculptors of the thirteenth century,
on the contrary, who possessed fully the grammar of their
art, expressed all they felt, and have left us the most divine images
of Jesus Christ in existence.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>"Italy of the Renaissance is quite unintelligible to any one who
has not measured the place held by art in the preoccupations not
only of artists who practice it, but of all men of all conditions&mdash;of
princes, nobles, tradesmen, and of citizens of most humble occupations.
No one in any rank is without a passionate love for plastic
beauty. This love was Italy's life and Italy's death. She died
of it, because all her sap was consumed in satisfying it. It made
her indifferent to her dismemberment, to the hard yoke of her
tyrants, to the loss of her political liberties, and of her independence.
But, at the same time, it constituted the intensity of her
life which was exhausted and renewed again in the ardor with
which she pursued her ideal and in her endeavors to realize it under
all its aspects. Let him who would wish to obtain an exact idea
of this condition reside for a while in Mantua, in Parma, in Sienna,
in Florence, or in any other less-known city which nevertheless
had its local school of art, its architects, its sculptors, its painters,
some of whom, though they only worked for their native city, were
not far from manifesting genius.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>"The written history of the seventeenth century and its rich
literature can not alone give an idea of the situation occupied by
Louis XIV in Europe when he was admired, imitated, or rather
servilely copied, as pre-eminently the type of the modern king even
by those who hated him the most. After two centuries, have we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
not seen his wonderful prestige still potent in dominating the sickly
mind of Louis II of Bavaria? In his desire to copy his chosen
model Louis ruined himself in building palaces. In this folly he
showed discrimination. Louis XIV, when dying, may have accused
himself of having indulged too great a love for building; but
his edifices, with their majestic grandeur and the opulence of their
decoration, gave that royal life a frame which had much to do with
the dazzling which all Europe experienced when in the presence
of <i>le Roi Soleil</i>. In order to recognize and experience, though
but for a moment, a little of the impression felt by all contemporaries,
Versailles must be visited; the apartments of the palace, the
terraces, and the alleys of the park must be traversed. Thus will
be thrown upon this historic figure a light far more brilliant and
true than could possibly be the result of learning by heart accounts
of all the campaigns of Turenne or Cond&eacute;, or all the clauses of the
treaties of Nim&egrave;gue and Ryswick.</p>

<p>"The same may be said of the eighteenth century, of which
only an incomplete idea can be had without a knowledge of its art.
This century, to which Voltaire gave the note, seems to have had
no sentiment of poetry. Down to the time of Andr&eacute; Chenier
everything called poetry was no more than rhymed prose. The
imagination, however, did not lose its rights. Like a stream which
changes its bed, it withdrew from literature to flow into the arts
of design. There it gives evidence of invention and of light and
spontaneous grace. Architects adopt plans of happy arrangement.
They employ forms of rare elegance both in the elements of construction
and in the ornaments which decorate them. Such sculptors
as Capperi and Houdon give to portraiture a marvelous intensity
of life, while the terra cottas of Clodion, with their fantastic
and voluptuous charm, recall the clay modelers of antiquity. Such
painters as Greuze, Lancret, and Boucher spread before the eyes
living idyls, while Watteau and Frangonard conjure dreams of
ideal Cytheras, of a chimerical paradise where reign eternal youth
and eternal desire. The politics of our kings and of our ministers
of the period is but a succession of faults and weaknesses. The
best concerted plans come to naught. The most brilliant victory
produces no useful results. If France, in spite of so many reverses,
still held her supremacy in Europe, she owed it to her writers and
to her artists."</p>

<p>Perrot's arguments might be used with even greater force in
reference to those notions which have had no Comines, no Joinville,
no Froissart, no Villehardouin, but the history of whose
civilization may be traced in monuments along the Rhine and the
Danube, the Ems and the Elbe. In the last part of the article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Perrot considers the best methods of giving the desired instruction.
However interesting and valuable his suggestions may be in communities
where the instruction has already been established, it is
evident that there must first be a conviction of the value and necessity
of such studies and the determination to have them started.
Methods are not difficult to devise, and will vary with national and
individual tastes. That American colleges of thirty, forty, or fifty
years ago should have objected to the introduction of the history
of the fine arts into their curricula is easily understood. Art in
any form was regarded by the New England mind as an emanation
of the devil, and the New England mind controlled American
colleges. Why the repugnance continues to exist is harder to understand.
It may subsist from ignorance, from prejudice, or from
conservatism. Conservatism may still regard all information to
be derived from art as objectionable. Prejudice may still be
strongly fixed in the notion that written and spoken words are the
only vehicles of instruction, and that the arts are useless and idle
vanities, while ignorance may be awaiting demonstration which will
have to be strong and conclusive to awake it from self-satisfied
apathy. May the good words of Perrot help on the cause and accelerate
the time when the best and the fullest education will be
offered by the American university!</p>

<h2>HOW STANDARD TIME IS OBTAINED.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By T. B. WILLSON, M. A.</span></p>


<p>Almost everybody knows that observatories are the places
from which standard time is sent out and corrected daily
or hourly. But comparatively few have more than the vaguest
idea of the means used at the observatories for obtaining it.</p>

<p>Probably the majority of people suppose that the observatories
obtain the correct time from the sun. When the average man
wishes to give his watch the highest praise he says, "It regulates
the sun," not being aware that a watch which would keep with
the sun around the year would have to be nearly as bad as Sam
Weller's. The farmer may safely decide when to go in to dinner
by the sun, but if the mariner was as confident that the sun marked
always the correct time as the farmer is he would be sure to be
at times two or three hundred miles from where he thought he
was. In other words, the sun&mdash;that is, a sundial&mdash;is only correct
on a few days in each year, and during the intervening times gets
as far as a whole quarter hour fast or slow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>These variations of the sun from uniform time caused no end
of trouble between the astronomers and the fine clockmakers before
it was discovered that sun time is subject to such irregularities.
The better the clock, the worse it often seemed to go.</p>

<p>But as the variations in sun time are now accurately known,
correct time might be obtained from the sun by making proper
allowance, were it not for the difficulty of observing its position,
with sufficient exactness. The large disk of the sun can not be
located so perfectly as can the single point which a star makes.
For this reason astronomers depend almost wholly upon the stars
for obtaining accurate time. It is the method of doing this which
we propose to describe.</p>

<p>There are several hundred stars whose positions have been established
with the greatest accuracy by the most careful observations
at a number of the principal observatories of the world.
If a star's exact position is known, it can readily be calculated
when it will pass the meridian of any given place&mdash;that is, the instant
it will cross a north-and-south line through the place. The
data regarding these stars are all published in the nautical almanacs,
which are got out by several different observatories for the
use of navigators and all others who have uses for them. These
stars are known as "clock stars."</p>

<p>Every observatory is provided with at least one, or, better,
several clocks that are very accurate indeed. Every appliance
and precaution which science can suggest is resorted to to make
these clocks accurate. The workmanship is, of course, very fine.
What is known as the "retaining click" prevents their losing a
single beat while being wound. The small variations in the length
of the pendulum which changes of temperature would cause are
offset by compensation. The rise of the mercury in the pendulum
bob, if the weather grows warmer, shortens the pendulum precisely
as much as the expansion of its rod lengthens it, and conversely
if it becomes colder. Such clocks, too, are set on stone
piers built up from below the surface of the ground and wholly
independent of the building itself. Often the clocks are made
with air-tight cases, and sometimes are placed in tightly closed
chambers, only to be entered when absolutely necessary. Some
fine clocks even have appliances for offsetting barometric changes,
but these affect such clocks less than other influences or imperfections
which can not be accounted for, and thus they are seldom
provided against.</p>

<p>The astronomer's principal clock&mdash;the one he uses in all his
calculations&mdash;marks what is known as sidereal, not ordinary, time.
The revolution of the earth in its orbit sets the sun back in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
place in the heavens at the rate of about four minutes a day, or
one whole day in a year, so that this clock, indicating star time,
gains this amount and is only with ordinary clocks once a year.
After it is once adjusted, no attempt is made to regulate it exactly,
as the astronomer would better calculate its differences than
disturb its regulation, always provided its rate is very uniform and
accurately known.</p>

<p>One or more of the other clocks, however, are made to show
ordinary time, and corrected by observations taken every few days.
It is from this clock that the standard time is sent out.</p>

<p>It is possible to connect any of these clocks telegraphically
with an instrument in the observatory, known as a chronograph.
It consists of a cylinder with a sheet of paper around it, on which
rests a pen connected with the telegraphic instrument which follows
the beats of the clock. The cylinder is turned slowly by
clockwork, and the pen, carried slowly along by a screw, describes
a spiral on the paper with jogs or teeth in it about a quarter of
an inch apart, caused by the beats of the clock. In this way the
astronomer secures a visible record of the beating of his clock,
or rather of the movements of his telegraphic recorder. Thus,
if he has another key on the same circuit with the clock, connected
with his chronograph recorder, and should touch it between
the beats of his clock, it would put in an extra jog or tooth on his
record, and it will show, what he could not have told in any other
way, in just what part of the second he touched this key, whether
in the first or last part of the second, and precisely how far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
either end&mdash;that is, he can determine fractions of a second with
great nicety.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he has such a key at the telescope which
he uses to make his observations in taking time, so that when he
wishes to record the precise instant in which anything takes place
which he is viewing through his telescope he has but to press the
key in his hand and an extra tooth will be put into the record
which the clock is making, somewhere among the regular teeth
put in by the beating of the clock. Later, when he takes out the
sheet he can see just where the tooth came, and so at what instant
it was. If, now, he knows exactly what the instant was according
to the true time as given in his almanacs&mdash;that is, what his clock
ought to have shown at that instant&mdash;he can tell how nearly right
his clock is. Once knowing how this clock is, it is a simple calculation
to find how the clock which sends the signals is running, and
to alter it if needed in a manner we shall describe later.</p>

<p>The observations the astronomer makes use of to determine
these instants of time are upon the "clock stars." He uses a
rather small telescope, known as a transit. It is placed with the
nicest accuracy in a north-and-south line. It can turn over vertically,
but can not move sideways out of its line. Its alignment
is kept perfect by occasionally sighting some small mark a few
rods from the observatory, either north or south.</p>

<p>If the astronomer points this transit, say, halfway up the southern
heavens and sees a star pass across the center of its field he
knows that that instant gives, as it were, the "noon mark" of
that star. If it is one of the "clock stars," he knows by his tables
what that instant of time is&mdash;should be&mdash;by his clock.</p>

<p>We have seen what his means are of comparing his clock and
his observations. But observe, now, how much pains he takes to
get the most exact observations.</p>

<p>To begin with, he must have calculated to a nicety his location.
The director of an observatory always knows where he is
located in a sense that few other men do. The accuracy of a large
part of his observations of any kind depends on his first having
determined the latitude and longitude of his observatory within a
very few feet. Then the data given by his tables are all modified,
and adapted to conform to his locality.</p>

<p>There are stretched across in the eyepiece of his transit five
spider lines. The central one is on the central line of the field
of his instrument. In observing a star for time the astronomer
watches it as it is carried by the rotation of the earth past each
of these spider lines, and presses his key&mdash;that is, makes a record&mdash;as
it crosses each line. Taking the average of these five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
observations, he makes the possible error very small. But, in addition
to this, he also usually makes observations on at least four
clock stars, which gives him twenty observations to average up
and determine by. As he inspects the record of these observations
which has gone upon the chronograph sheet along with the
clock beats he is able to determine, after proper calculations, how
his clock stands.</p>

<p>Such observations are made every three or four evenings, and
thus the clocks are not given time to get far out of the way. It
is not usual for a good clock to show a variation of more than half
a second. If the astronomer finds that his clock which is sending
the time is running a fraction of a second slow, he goes to it
and lays on the top of the pendulum bob a minute clipping of
metal, which is equivalent to shortening the pendulum an infinitesimal
amount. When he takes his next observation he discovers
how his clock has been affected, and again treats it accordingly.
Thus the time that is sent out automatically by the clock
is kept always correct within a small fraction of a second. Those
who receive the time sometimes arrange electro-magnets near the
pendulums of their clocks, which act with the beats of the observatory
clock, and their attraction is enough to hold or accelerate
the pendulums as needed to make them synchronize with the observatory
clock.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the means of obtaining exact time involve
a very considerable outlay, and that the services of highly trained
men are needed. The public is thus greatly indebted to the railroads,
telephone companies, and other corporations which usually
bear the expense of securing standard time. It is probable, however,
that from motives of scientific pride no observatory would
undertake to charge for this anything like what would be exacted
for such rare service in any department of the commercial world.</p>

<p>It is worth while to note that even with such perfect clocks
and favorable conditions it is still impossible to secure perfect timekeeping.
Add to this the fact that it is not usual for those who
send out the time, after it has been received from the observatory,
to pay much heed to variations, even of several seconds, in their
master clocks, and we see why it is a disheartening task to keep
the best watch as near the second as the owner would fain have it.
In the first place, the watch could hardly be made to keep such
time if kept still in an unchanging temperature; secondly, it is
still less capable of it when subjected to the jolting and changes
of temperature it encounters when carried; and, thirdly, the
means of obtaining time with sufficient exactitude are rarely available
to the general public.</p>

<h2>AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. E. DE RIEMER, M. A.</span></p>


<p>The recent death, at the closing of the year 1898, of the
lamented Senator Justin S. Morrill, who, as being the author
of the Land-Grant College Act, is justly styled the father of agricultural
education in the United States, seems to suggest the desirability
of taking a survey of agricultural education as it at present
exists in other countries than our own.</p>

<p>Since the pursuit of agriculture is one which concerns more of
the people of our globe than any other pursuit, the necessity for
scientific training for agriculturists becomes more and more evident
to educated people. It is true that the cultivators of the soil do not
generally admit the need of special schooling. At the beginning of
this century very few educators, even, thought so. It was supposed
that tilling the soil had nothing to do with schools, and that science
had no connection with plowing and sowing. Agricultural lectureships
were established early in the eighteenth century in several
European universities, but they were regarded as curiosities of the
age&mdash;superfluities of culture, rather than aids to the cultivator.
Farmers themselves were supposed to be the only competent teachers
of agriculture, and experience the only possible guide. But it
has become apparent that no farmer's experience is broad enough
to be adapted to all soils and climates. The successful farmer has
come to regard the land which he owns as a wonderful machine
which, if rightly managed, will turn out the most costly and perfect
product; but which, if neglected or ignorantly handled, will
disappoint his high hopes and possibly impoverish its owner. The
development of commerce which so easily introduces the wheat
and potatoes and other products of our country into competition
with the grain produced in a distant land has taught the producers
of this generation, and especially the citizen of European countries,
that the farmer who can produce the largest crop of grain from
the fewest acres, at the lowest price for the best cereal or vegetable,
is the only successful cultivator. The nation which succeeds best
in this direction with all its soil products is the one which is sure
to have the "balance of trade" always in its favor.</p>

<p>The United States awoke to this idea when, in 1862, Congress
passed the Land-Grant College Act, allotting Government lands in
every State to aid in founding agricultural colleges. The country
became more profoundly moved by this idea when, in 1887, Congress
passed the Hatch Act, granting annually to each State the
sum of fifteen thousand dollars to organize and perpetuate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
agricultural experiment stations, and still further when it organized
a Department of Experiment Stations as an integral part of the
Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>But several of the countries of Europe have anticipated our
action in behalf of agricultural education by a quarter of a century.
Germany and France and little Switzerland realized fifty years ago
that agriculture in its various departments must be pursued with
the aid of the latest science combined with the broadest experience.
These countries have not waited for the laborer to perfect himself
in experience&mdash;an impossible attainment&mdash;but they have opened
schools of every possible grade, arranged courses of lectures by the
best educated scientists, made elementary agriculture a compulsory
subject in the curricula of the common schools, sent out traveling
instructors to confer with and advise and give courses of lectures
to the older farmers, made it possible&mdash;even compulsory&mdash;that
young people should attend technical schools at odd hours of
the day or evening, and even tempted them to pass a serious examination
in their respective studies by the offer of a valuable prize as
the reward of success. It is said that Charles Dickens once made
a speech at an agricultural dinner in which he somewhat derisively
said that "the field it paid the farmer best to cultivate was the one
within the ring fence of his own skull." Dickens was correct. The
farmer needs scientific education. The best civilized and progressive
nations of to-day are admitting the utterance of Dickens to be a
serious truth. Vast sums of money are appropriated by European
governments to prevent their agricultural classes from continuing
in or subsiding into ignorance of their art. Even the peasants of
Russia, notably in the province of Ekaterinoslav, by the generous
appliances for special agricultural education made by the Ministry
of Agriculture and State Domains, united with the efforts of the
Ministry of Public Instruction, are made to feel that without expert
teaching a man can not succeed even in the raising of fowls or of
bees, the culture of silkworms, the making of wine, or the manuring
of his fields. Consul Heenan<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> says that in the province named
above the Government annually rents thirty-two experiment fields,
each eight acres in extent, distributed four in each district, and each
one located in the midst of peasant fields. Each of these fields is
placed in charge of some scientifically educated public-school teacher,
who is paid twenty-five dollars per year for his direction, and
receives, besides, all the harvest produced. The teacher uses the
native tools and seeds, and hires neighbor peasants to assist in demonstrating
that with care in plowing, cleaning of seed, cultivating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and reaping, his field will produce larger crops than his slovenly or
ignorant neighbor. The object lesson has its certain result. The
peasants are gradually adopting the four-field culture system&mdash;viz.,
fallow, winter crops, pastures, and summer crops.</p>

<p>Besides these, Russia sustains 68 agricultural schools, containing
3,157 pupils, at a cost of $403,500, of which sum the Government
pays $277,500, and the local <i>zemstovs</i> (societies) or the school
founders pay $136,000.</p>

<p>In France the eminent scientist Lavoisier, at the close of the
last century, advocated the founding of a national school for the
teaching of agricultural science. His plan for government initiation
was not realized, but in 1822 Matthieu de Dombasle founded,
near Nancy, the first true agricultural school. In 1829 and 1830
the schools at Grignon and Grandjouan were founded by August
Bella and Riefell respectively. Now France boasts of one of the
most perfect systems of agricultural education of any country of
the world. Under the joint direction of her Ministers of Agriculture
and of Public Instruction, France plans to cover every phase
of education from the simplest forms of object lessons taught by
law in all her primary schools to the crowning National Institute
of Agriculture at Paris. The facts of science, united with the
soundest experience, are demonstrated to the farmer by lectures
and experimentation; the future agriculturists of the country are
educated in the certainties of scientific research at graded schools,
ranging from elementary to university degrees, and every milkmaid
is taught the necessity of promptness, cleanliness, and system
in the care of milch cows and in the disposal of their milk.</p>

<p>The former able Director-General of French Agriculture, Monsieur
Tisserand, says: "The aim and object of France has been not
only to give to children and young people the means of acquiring
knowledge, but also to establish means for <i>interesting old cultivators</i>.
In this century of extreme competition we must admit that
the agriculturist can only thrive if, in working the soil, he adopts
scientific methods. Old routine is no longer sufficient in this
branch, as it is proved to be insufficient in manufacture." In carrying
out her enlightened policy, instruction was given in 1893<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
to 3,600 pupil teachers. Thirty agricultural laboratories throughout
the country furnish analyses of soils and manures for the help
of cultivators, and 3,362 trial fields are established where farmers
can profit by experiments suitable to their own districts. The
special farm schools number sixteen; practical schools of agriculture,
thirty-nine; national schools of agriculture and horticulture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
six; three veterinary schools; and one each, bearing the name of
National Agronomic Institute, is a shepherd school, a cheese, and
a silkworm school. In the universities are no less than 160 departments
and chairs of agriculture for students of profoundest research.
All this costs the departments alone over 4,504,050 francs
per annum.</p>

<p>In Prussian Germany no less activity is displayed or energy put
forth to make the farmer's occupation one of financial profit and
scientific status. Statistics for 1897 are at hand in the report of
the Prussian Minister of Agriculture. The German system is
based on the theory that schools and colleges are the only places
where theoretical agriculture can be properly taught. Few of the
higher agricultural schools first established were exclusively such.
A liberal education could be obtained at most of them without
touching the subject of agriculture. Later educators have developed
a system which begins by fostering a love for Nature in the
minds of the pupils in the kindergarten, and patiently develops that
love through all the dozen or more grades of schools until it culminates
in the polytechnic school or the degree granted by the
university.</p>

<p>Germany is indebted to the learned Professor Thaer for the
establishment of its first agricultural school at M&ouml;glin in 1807.
But more than all is she, in common with all the world, indebted
to the famous chemist Baron von Liebig, who, in 1840, announced
the scientific truth which underlies all arguments for agricultural
education&mdash;viz., that no matter how impoverished a soil is naturally,
or has become by excessive cropping, its fertility may be
restored, maintained, and even increased by providing it with the
mineral and organic matter which it lacks.</p>

<p>Prussian agricultural affairs are under the supervision of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Domains, and Forests. The state maintains
three grades of schools&mdash;higher, middle, and lower&mdash;as in
other European countries. The most celebrated are the Royal Agricultural
High Schools at Berlin and Popplesdorf, two royal academies
of forestry, and the university courses in agriculture at Halle,
G&ouml;ttingen, K&ouml;nigsberg, Leipsic, Giessen, and Jena. The state expends
something like two hundred thousand dollars annually on
agricultural education. In Germany agricultural education has so
broadened out as to include training in every technical part of a
farmer's work&mdash;culture of forests, fruits, flowers, and vines;
schools to teach wine, cider, and beer making, machine repairing,
engine running, barn construction, and surveying; knowledge of
poultry, bees, and silkworm raising; domestic economy, sewing,
and accounts for farm women&mdash;all in addition to the long scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
courses of study and years of practical work on an established farm.
Verily, the country that excels Germany in training agriculturists
must be <i>par excellence</i> in its methods.</p>

<p>A special feature of agricultural teaching is the traveling professor
(<i>Wanderlehrer</i>). United States Consul Monaghan enthusiastically
describes him: "These teachers, supported partly by the
state and by agricultural unions, go from place to place ... and
lecture on agricultural and horticultural subjects. Their purpose
is to lift up and ennoble agricultural life; to afford the farmer the
knowledge gleaned by science since he left the school; to impart to
him the best methods of selecting soils, fertilizers, cattle, trees, etc.;
to teach him how to use his lands to best advantage, to graft, to
breed in; to get the best, quickest, and most profitable results.
These teachers are skilled scientists, practical workers, not theorists,
... perfectly familiar with the wants and needs of their districts.
Armed with this knowledge, the teacher's usefulness is certain
and unlimited. When he speaks his voice is that of one in
authority, it is heeded.... He is a walking encyclop&aelig;dia of
knowledge, especially of knowledge pertaining to the woods, hills,
farms, and fields."</p>

<p>Austria has, like Germany, a system of agricultural and forestry
schools in three grades&mdash;viz., superior, middle, and lower. Its oldest
school of superior grade was established in 1799 at Krumman.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Similar schools existed later at Gr&auml;tz, Trieste, Lemberg, Trutsch,
and Altenburg. The latter is especially complete in every appliance
for instruction, and well patronized. The middle schools provide
two-year courses of study and practice, and are located at
Grossan, Kreutz, Dublany, and other points, while the lower schools
incline less to study and more to lectures and farm practice. They
are located in the provinces of Bohemia, Styria, Galicia, and Carinthia.</p>

<p>Forestry schools of various grades exist at Mariabrunn, Wissewasser,
Aussen, Pibram, Windschact, and Nagny; of these, Mariabrunn
is especially deserving of mention for its thorough course
and complete equipment.</p>

<p>Switzerland was the home of the philanthropist and educator
Fellenburg. His school, established at Hopyl in 1806, was a philanthropy
in aid of the peasantry, concerning whom he said that
possessing nothing but bodies and minds, the cultivation of these
was the only antidote for their poverty. At least three thousand
pupils received their education in agriculture here. The Federal
Polytechnic School at Zurich is the nation's pride. Out of six
courses of superior training which it provides for its one thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
students, forestry and agriculture count as two. Five universities
and numerous special schools furnish aid to agricultural education.</p>

<p>The little kingdoms of Belgium and Holland are following hard
upon the tracks of their powerful neighbors. In Belgium may
be found superior institutions of agriculture, horticulture, veterinary
science, and forestry at Gembloux, Vilvorde, Cureghem, and
Bouillon respectively.</p>

<p>In Holland, whose people robbed the sea to obtain lands for
farms and homes, about &pound;71,500 were expended by the state on
its agricultural department in 1897. Its first school, established
by a communal society at H&auml;ren in 1842, was discontinued. The
state in 1876 adopted the school of agriculture which has been
established at Wageningen as its own, and this institution can fairly
lay claim to equality with any in Europe. Government also supports
the State Veterinary College at Utrecht, and subsidizes a
school of forestry and several dairy schools. Agricultural teaching
in primary schools has not yet proved a success.</p>

<p>Italy has not made such progress in agricultural education as
her northern neighbors, yet she is not indifferent to the requirements
of the times. She has a most unique scheme for Government
superintendence of agricultural matters. All comes under
the purview of a general Director of Agriculture, assisted by a
Council for Agricultural Instruction, which latter was established
by royal decree in 1885, and reorganized in 1887. Four divisions
of the department exist&mdash;namely, (1) agriculture proper, (2) zo&ouml;techny,
(3) forestry, and (4) agricultural hydraulics. Statistics are
not easily procured, but recent catalogues show that the two Royal
Superior Schools of Agriculture, located respectively at Milan and
Portici, are institutions of which any country might be proud. Of
the latter Mr. E. Neville Rolfe, British consul, wrote in 1897 that
it was originally a provincial establishment, but in 1885 it had been
established by royal charter and domiciled in the magnificent
grounds and buildings of a disused royal palace. Its study course
requires three years to complete, and graduates obtain the degree
of Laureato Agronomo. Up to 1896, two hundred and twenty-eight
students had obtained this degree, most of whom are instructors
or Government employees of high rank. It is known also that
thirty-three special and practical agricultural schools exist in different
parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Much can not be said in praise of agricultural education in
Spain. That country possesses the machinery for education of the
higher grades, but through her seven distinctly agricultural colleges,
located at Madrid, Saragossa, Barcelona, Corunna, Valencia,
Caceres, and Jerez, she seems only to have obtained men for Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
service at home or abroad. Spain expended in 1896 on
agricultural education the sum of &pound;58,460, but she evidently sends
no <i>Wanderlehrer</i> instructors among her peasant farmers.</p>

<p>It is said that Portugal possesses seven agricultural schools, attended
in 1896 by one hundred and eighty-seven students, but of
their location, save one, and courses of study the writer has no information.
The Government conduct of education is committed
to a Director-General of Agriculture. The leading school is named
the General Institute of Agriculture, and is located at Lisbon. It
provides four courses&mdash;viz., (1) rural engineering, (2) agronomy,
(3) sylviculture, (4) veterinary medicine. It has a large tract of
land for demonstration purposes located a few miles from the city.</p>

<p>Concerning Greece and the smaller kingdoms in southeastern
Europe, together with the land of the Turk, not much to the encouragement
of the scientific agriculturist can be said; but turning
northward across Europe to the Scandinavian countries quite a
different state of things becomes apparent. At once we find that
the system of agricultural education is highly developed, and in
some phases is not surpassed by other countries. Immediately we
are in a network of dairy schools, experiment stations, chemical
and seed-control stations, agricultural societies, colleges, and universities.
Here we find five institutions all under royal patronage
and state support. In Norway is the Higher Agricultural School
at Aas, established in 1859. In Sweden stands the Agricultural
Institute at Ultuna, established in 1849, and the Alnarp Agricultural
and Dairy Institute, established in 1862. In Denmark is
the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College at Copenhagen,
established in 1773 as a veterinary college. In Finland the Mustiala
Agricultural and Dairy Institute, established in 1840. In
these four small states there exist agricultural, horticultural, forestry,
and dairy schools of all grades to the number of one hundred
and fifty-nine. Education in agriculture is not attempted in the
primary public schools of Norway or in any of these Scandinavian
countries, but agricultural elementary instruction is begun in what
other continental countries would call secondary schools, and is
provided for persons intending to be farmers and who are eighteen
years of age and older. Norway spent on elementary agricultural
education in secondary schools, in 1895-'96, the sum of
$31,182, and Finland more than doubled that sum.</p>

<p>Crossing the Channel to Great Britain, again we see a nation
intent on solving the question of success for her agricultural population.
Celebrated Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen early
began to plan for an educated peasantry, but it was long before any
national system was evolved. The sectional divisions and peculiarities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
belonging severally to Scot and Celt and Saxon have not yet
permitted a uniform legislation. Ireland and Scotland each has
its own scheme of Government supervision, and both differ from
England and Wales. It is estimated that but ten per cent of England's
laboring population is concerned with agriculture for support,
while in Ireland there is scarcely ten per cent of the people
who are not dependent on agriculture for existence. In consequence,
we find in Ireland, as in France, intense interest centers
upon the plan to teach agriculture and horticulture in the elementary
public schools, while in England, until very recently, agricultural
education served principally to produce a class of educated
scientific men fitted for the Government home and colonial service.</p>

<p>In Ireland compulsory attendance on primary schools is made
by law. In 1876 Ireland claimed to be the pioneer country in providing
compulsory elementary agricultural instruction in all her
rural schools. She has desperately clung to the theory that in
providing such education in her elementary schools she would
eventually train a nation of agriculturists. To attain this end, elementary
text-books were prepared, which all teachers must use.
The Government grant for a pass at examination in agriculture was
much larger than a pass in any other study; teachers who held certificates
to teach it were given higher salaries than others, and to
enable teachers to prepare for such certificates, scholarships were offered
them at teachers' colleges (normal schools), and their railway
fare was free in going and coming. Plots of ground at schoolhouse
or teacher's house were provided, where flower and vegetable culture
could be constantly practiced, and a special grant was allowed
to the school for cultivating a successful garden, and another special
for classes showing proficiency in practical work. Gardens
were cultivated at convents and workhouses, and the subject was
taught theoretically to "half-time" pupils and students at the
"evening continuation schools."</p>

<p>In December, 1896, Ireland had 8,606 national schools, with
an average attendance of 815,248 pupils. She also had 150 half-time
schools, 155 workhouse schools, 267 convent schools, 30 model
schools, five training colleges for teachers, and two training agricultural
institutes (at Glassnevin and at Munster), and in all of these
agricultural science or practice is either a compulsory or a voluntary
subject. What country can surpass Ireland's enthusiasm for
agricultural training?<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<p>Scotland enjoys deservedly the distinction of having been first
among the peoples of Europe to introduce in the university course
scientific education in agriculture. In 1790 a chair was established
in the University of Edinburgh, and a course of agricultural lectures
was given therefrom by Rev. D. Walker. Better than that,
in 1743 a volume entitled Select Transactions was published by
Maxwell, representing the agricultural society known as the "Society
of Improvers," and numbering at one time three hundred
members. Out of this society grew the "Highland and Agricultural
Society," which organization has fostered every agricultural
effort which private beneficence or royal grant has initiated in the
land since 1834. Through its munificence both the departments of
forestry and veterinary surgery have been placed upon a firm educational
basis, and the educational lectureship of Edinburgh University
has been permanently endowed. It has instituted its own
syllabus of examinations for granting "Fellowships in Agriculture,"
and stimulated pupils of the secondary schools to make the
effort by offering prizes and scholarships to the ambitious students.</p>

<p>The University of Aberdeen has lately entered the field as an
agricultural educator by becoming what the Government styles a
"collegiate center," receiving a straight subsidy of &pound;100 per annum,
and furnishing professional instructors to rural assemblies
arranging lectures for them. In the public schools of Scotland
agricultural science is arranged for as an optional study from the
third to the sixth standards inclusive. In 1895-'96, 4,148 pupils
passed examinations in the subject, and the cost of this to the state
was &pound;42,792. In 1896-'97 pupils in the "evening continuation
schools" to the number of 1,089 passed in agriculture, and 115
others in horticulture.</p>

<p>England and Wales are under a joint administration of agricultural
affairs. The Government policy, so far as it has one, has
been continually opposed to paternalism and direct subsidy or ownership
of schools. Rather has her Parliament waited to be solicited
to make subventions by way of encouraging individual or local
society initiative. The flourishing agricultural schools at Cirencester
and Downton, for the instruction of the higher classes, have
grown out of private establishments, then been perpetuated by obtaining
royal charters, by which the Government became pledged
to supply any lack of income. But since 1893 the state has so far
relaxed her policy as to grant subsidies to certain colleges centrally
located, which it styles "collegiate centers," through which colleges
it offers superior instruction to the public. These colleges
associate with themselves ample farm lands for experiment grounds
and dairy machinery, and equip themselves with competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
lecturers, who are also practical experts, and who, upon invitation
from agricultural societies or county councils, go forth as lecturers
upon their special subjects. Each adjacent county makes an annual
grant of &pound;75 to the college funds, and is privileged to nominate
students to attend the college agricultural course at a reduction
of twenty-five per cent on the usual fee. In 1898-'99 the
Board of Education granted to fifteen colleges and associations in
England and Wales the sum of &pound;7,200. The colleges were the
Yorkshire College at Leeds, Durham College of Science at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
University Extension College at Reading, University
College at Nottingham, Southeastern Agricultural College at
Wye, and in Wales the University Colleges at Bangor and Aberystwith.</p>

<p>Besides the direct Government subsidy to higher education, the
state grants to the several counties part of the money raised from
the excise ("drink money") for educational purposes, out of which
at least &pound;78,000 were spent by the committees in 1896-'97 in promoting
agricultural education.</p>

<p>Still further, Parliament puts into the hands of the Science
and Art Department large sums of money to be expended as grants-in-aid
of "technical education." The state recognizes instruction
in the principles of agriculture as instruction in elementary science,
and through this Science and Art Department's grants to primary
and secondary schools, and to teachers' colleges, it encourages agricultural
education as a technical study. In 1896-'97, 1,023 pupils
passed examination, and the respective school managements received
as grant on their account a total sum of &pound;140,150.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>In 1897 the Royal Commission on Agricultural Depression in
England made its report. Among other declarations made by the
commission were these: "We believe that it is essential for the
welfare of agriculture that there should be placed within the reach
of every young farmer a sound, general school education, including
such a grounding in the elements of sciences bearing upon agriculture&mdash;e. g.,
chemistry, geology, botany, and animal physiology&mdash;as
will give him an intelligent interest in them and familiarize
him in their language."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>They further recommend that hereafter the control of all funds
for technical agricultural education be placed with the Board of
Agriculture, and that the entire income of the Customs and Excise
Act of 1890 should be devoted to educational purposes, agriculture
receiving its adequate share. Should the first recommendation
carry for all divisions of the United Kingdom, agriculture would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
cease to be one of the subjects provided for examination by the
Science and Art Department. Should the second recommendation
become a law, the sum expended by local county councils in
agricultural education would be vastly increased.</p>

<p>Passing from England to her colonies, let us journey toward
the sunrising. Stopping for a moment in Egypt, we note with
pleasure the existence of the newly established School of Agriculture
at Gizeh, which is under the direction of the Ministry of Public
Instruction for Egypt. Its reconstructed course of study was
open to students in 1898, and it provides for four years of study.
Arabic and English are the teaching languages, especially the latter,
and allotments of land for individual culture are made to all
pupils.</p>

<p>Beyond the Indian Ocean lies Hindustan. Here all science
study is awaiting its development. The best cultivation of India
is not behind that of England as a matter of empiricism,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but the
science of cultivation is yet to be developed. Agricultural chemistry
and agricultural botany and horticulture, as related to India,
have scarcely been investigated, and text-books in the native
tongues have yet to be written. For this accomplishment all elementary
instruction in public schools must patiently wait. For an
agriculturally educated set of teachers, also, Indian youth studying
in the vernacular must patiently wait. In 1889 the home
Government (Parliament) laid upon the Indian Educational Department
the duty of providing school "readers" which should
contain elementary instruction in agricultural science, and it authorized
a liberal grant-in-aid toward such schools as could furnish
pupils for passes in this subject. For those students who have mastered
the English language a few colleges exist. Saidapet, near
Madras, with about forty students in a three-years' course, including
veterinary, is a pure agricultural institution. Fourteen students
received diplomas in agriculture in March, 1897.</p>

<p>Several colleges have agricultural departments, notably the
Poona College of Science in the Bombay presidency; the Baroda
College; the Maharajah's College and the Shimoga College, Mysore;
the Central College, and the Sanskrit College of Bangalore.
All of these are affiliated with the University of Bombay, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
present pupils for examination in agriculture for the degree of
B. Sc. A.</p>

<p>In many of the English high schools of India are found agricultural
classes which give both science teaching and field practice.
These schools are at Nagpur, Nasik, Sholapur, Ahmednagar,
Ahmedabad, Dhulia, Kolapur, Surat, Belgaum, and Nadiad. The
stimulus to study in these schools is the hope of obtaining a diploma
in agriculture, which would result in employment in the Government
service.</p>

<p>In Lucknow is a celebrated veterinary school whose graduates
have been greatly sought after. One at Bombay has become still
more celebrated. In 1897 sixty-nine students were in attendance.
Graduates easily found employment with native rajahs, and on
the island of Ceylon, and at Mozambique. Another Government
veterinary school recently established at Belgatchia, Calcutta presidency,
has done good work.</p>

<p>The forestry school at Dehra Dun, in the Northwest Provinces,
has attained a great reputation. About seventy students attend,
and the Government charges the cost of the school, 33,000 rupees,
to the districts which send up pupils for study. India, under
the British rule, will soon come into line with educated agriculturists.</p>

<p>In Burmah and in Assam steps have been taken to introduce
science lessons into Government, or grant-in-aid, elementary schools
by the preparation of "readers," as in India, but no secondary or
superior schools in agriculture exist in these countries. So far as
we know, the same is true of Siam and the Malayan Archipelago
and of the Philippines.</p>

<p>Australia, as a federation of states, is late in its development,
but some of its states are surprisingly advanced. New Zealand
has its superior university, combining the three colleges at Auckland,
Lincoln, and Otago. Its syllabus provides for searching examinations
in agriculture to obtain the degree of B. Sc., either of
these colleges having previously granted the diploma of agriculture
to successful students. Each of these colleges has ample
grants of land, but only one&mdash;the Canterbury College at Lincoln&mdash;has
yet presented agricultural candidates. Forty-four graduates
have received diplomas previous to 1895. Instruction in elementary
schools seems not yet to have included agriculture.</p>

<p>In Queensland the Queensland Agricultural College was opened
at Gatton in 1897.</p>

<p>In South Australia is an agricultural college at Roseworthy
and another at Adelaide which has graduated several recipients
of the diploma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>In Victoria there exists a college at Dookia and another at
Longerong. There is also a school of horticulture at Richmond.</p>

<p>To New South Wales belongs the banner for furnishing the
greatest opportunities for agricultural education. Its university
at Sydney grants a degree of B. Sc. to students from the colleges
of St. Paul, St. John, St. Andrew, the Woman's College, and the
Sydney Grammar School. At Sydney also is the splendid Technical
College, handsomely endowed, having an agricultural department.
The superior of all other schools is the Hawksbury Agricultural
College and Experimental Farm at Richmond, established
in 1891, richly endowed with land (three thousand acres), and organized
on the most approved modern models. Science teaching
is not carried so high as the university standard, but all manner of
practical work must be performed by each student.</p>

<p>Homeward bound, we reach Cape Colony, South Africa.
Here, in 1887, the Government inaugurated a scheme for aiding
farm schools in which elementary agriculture was taught. In
1894, out of 352 schools aided by the Government, 202 were
classed as "farmhouse schools." In higher education there may
be found (1898) the School of Agriculture and Viticulture at
Stellenbosch, and a second one at Sunset East. As both of
these schools are young, statistics concerning them are not yet
available.</p>

<p>Last of England's colonies we notice the Dominion of Canada
on our northern frontier. No evident progress has been made in
introducing agricultural science teaching in the primary schools of
the entire Dominion. The first step taken in the direction of agricultural
education was for the enlightenment of farmers. In 1886
Parliament authorized the establishment of a system of experiment
farms, one in each province in Canada, viz.: one at Ottawa (to
serve both Quebec and Ontario), and one each at Nappan, in Nova
Scotia; at Brandon, Manitoba; at Indian Head, Assiniboia; at
Agassiz, British Columbia; and at Charlottetown, Prince Edward
Island. To give these stations greater efficiency, the Government
encouraged the formation of farmers' institutes in every electoral
district for the hearing of lectures from experts which it provided,
and for discussion or business. To each regularly organized institute
of fifty members a grant of &pound;10 is annually made.</p>

<p>In Nova Scotia five primary and secondary schools are reported
as giving agricultural instruction to two hundred pupils. Some of
these schools have farms or gardens. The Provincial School of
Agriculture at Truro is making a good beginning. In its last class
three students were granted teachers' diplomas, seven received
farmers' diplomas, and eighteen took farmers' certificates. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
hundred and fifty students have pursued its course of studies.
There is also a horticultural school at Annapolis Valley.</p>

<p>Another horticultural school exists at Wolfville, Nova Scotia,
under the control of a committee of the Fruit-Growers' Association.
Students take a thorough course of two years' duration. The
Legislatures of New Brunswick and of Prince Edward Island grant
bonuses of fifty dollars to each young man of their provinces who
will take a course at this school.</p>

<p>Fine creamery plants are found at various points, and several
provinces sustain each a "traveling dairy," which systematically
visits accessible centers and gives demonstration lectures to farmers'
families.</p>

<p>The crowning agricultural educational institution for the entire
Dominion is the college at Guelph, Ontario. It combines instruction
in veterinary science, horticulture, bee and poultry keeping,
dairying, and the experimental farm. The course continues
for three years. Two years confers the "associate diploma," and
three years' study, with successful examination in the syllabus of
the Toronto University, secures the degree of B. Sc. A. Success
attends all these educational efforts and marks this colonial empire
as among the ranks representing true progress.</p>

<p>Mexico and the countries of South America next claim our
notice. In the first-named country, as early as the year 1850 provision
was made at the old college of San Gregorio for instruction
in agriculture in five different courses. But in 1854 the Government
came into possession of the disused convent of San Jacinto,
Agosta. Here a national school was organized, combining the two
departments of agriculture and veterinary science. It was opened
February 22, 1854, and designated the National School of Agriculture
and Veterinary Science. Its courses of study are up to
the best standards. Three years are necessary to complete the
agricultural course and receive the title of Superintendent of Rural
Estates, and four years' study must be given to secure that of Ingeniero
Agronomo. The course was readjusted in 1893. During
the five years past 169 graduates have received the former and
68 the latter degrees. The management consists of 48 persons,
whose salaries annually cost the Government 96,424 Mexican dollars.
Ample grounds and buildings are provided to make this institution
a matter for national pride.</p>

<p>Besides this college, a farm school exists in one of the federal
districts, costing annually $17,564, and another at the colony of
Porfirio Diaz, costing the state $14,708. Mexico is also moving
to introduce agriculture as a subject for primary instruction in
public schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>In Uruguay exist fine schools for teaching agriculture and viticulture
which are of recent organization. At Montevideo the Government
has created a Department of Live Stock and Agriculture,
subject to the Home Ministry. The budget of 1897 provides for
organizing and sustaining agricultural schools and experiment
farms to the extent of $28,222, with an additional allowance of
$90,000 for experiments on farms, installation of plants, furniture,
instruments, etc.</p>

<p>Chili is coming to the front in her educational efforts. In the
city of Concepci&oacute;n exists a Practical School of Agriculture. Others
are found at Santiago, at Talca, San Fernando, Elqui, and Salamanca.
The school at Santiago receives an annual subvention of
$40,000, and that at Concepci&oacute;n the sum of $23,000. Attached to
the latter are agronomic stations for soil analysis and oversight of
irrigation systems of the state. The Sociedad Nacional de Agricultur
at Santiago receives an annual grant of $20,000, which it distributes
at agricultural shows and for the support of the zo&ouml;logical
garden. At Quintan Normal is also an Institute Agricola of high
grade for agricultural engineers and agronomics, or for furnishing
a simple certificate in agriculture.</p>

<p>Other countries of South America possess education facilities,
but we are not supplied with details concerning them.</p>

<p>Our closing glance must be directed to the far Orient. Japan,
the newest of kingdoms, has a model brace of institutions for superior
education in agriculture. When Japan awoke to the new
ideas, to which for ages she was oblivious, her keenest statesmen
grasped the thought that her agricultural people needed new light
and intellectual quickening along the lines which so vitally affected
their daily subsistence. She took the United States into her confidence.
She imported for a season our Commissioner of Agriculture
(General Capron), in 1871-'72, as "Adviser to the Colonial
Office at Hokaido," who, after visiting Japan, advised the Government
to organize at once an agricultural college at Sapporo, and
still another at Tokio. This advice was cordially received and
speedily adopted. American scholars of the highest wisdom and
experience were imported to inaugurate the work. The college
was inaugurated by Colonel W. S. Clark, LL. D., President of Amherst
Agricultural College, in August, 1876, with twenty-four students.
Its new location was Sapporo, and its new name was the
Sapporo Agricultural College. The Government dealt liberally in
grants of land, but these ample acres have since been mostly confiscated,
leaving only sufficient for educational purposes. Few
can estimate the wonderful uplift which has come to Japan through
this efficient school. In 1893 it had sent out from its agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
course 123 graduates; from the engineering, 4; military, 42; and
from the practical department, 114.</p>

<p>In 1874 an agricultural department was added to the Imperial
University at Tokio, the original location of the Sapporo College.
An exhaustive syllabus in the Department of Agriculture provides
examination for many profound students of this science, and admits
them to the highest university degree. Four courses are open
in the university&mdash;viz., agriculture, agricultural chemistry, forestry,
and veterinary medicine. In 1895 there were 261 students of
agriculture in the university.</p>

<p>From this extended though by no means exhaustive review
of the status of scientific instruction in agriculture throughout the
world, it is evident that all the progressive nations have caught the
inspiration which attaches to this branch of education, and are
swinging into line in their efforts to adopt it. Old ideals are rapidly
giving place to the new. Educators are forced to admit that
mental culture is as possible under the study of science as by the
protracted study of languages and literature; that such study aids
vastly more than the latter in the training which prepares men for
the active duties of life; and that if the development of husbandry
as a pursuit does not keep pace on an intelligent basis with every
other technical pursuit, national greatness and permanence will
never be achieved.</p>

<h2>EASTERN OYSTER CULTURE IN OREGON.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By F. L. WASHBURN, A. M.</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">STATE BIOLOGIST AND PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON.</span></p>


<p>During the past two years the United States Fish Commission,
with characteristic enterprise, has been carrying on experiments
in the propagation of Eastern oysters in the bays of the
Oregon coast. Work of a similar nature is now being undertaken
in the State of Washington.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 666px;">
<img src="images/illo_098_oystercity.jpg" width="666" height="354" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">"Oyster City," Yaquina Bay, Oregon.</span></span>
</div>

<p>As the result of an application through official sources, re-enforced
possibly by the results of a biological survey made by this
department during the preceding summer, twenty-two barrels of
Eastern oysters were, on November 7, 1896, deposited on a portion
of Oysterville Flat, so called, in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, seven miles
and a half from the ocean. The oystermen of that section have
agreed to abstain from tonging for native oysters upon the portion
of the flat thus reserved until sufficient time has elapsed to
justify an opinion as to the result of the experiment. These introduced
oysters were of two varieties&mdash;the long, slender East Rivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and the more oval, fan-shaped, and ribbed Princess Bays.
Their journey of twelve days across the continent, in sugar barrels,
from New York to San Francisco and thence to Oregon without
water did not cause the mortality one might expect, for in strewing
them over the bed from the scows of the oystermen very few
dead individuals were observed&mdash;certainly not one half of one
per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 666px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Experimental Spawning Float.</span></span>
</div>

<p>This alien oyster has much to contend with here. It was realized
that the cold and salt water rushing in from the Pacific&mdash;colder
and salter by far than in their Atlantic home at the same time&mdash;if
it did not entirely prevent spawning would at least make the
survival of the young embryos a matter of doubt; yet it was hoped
that perhaps, after a number of years, the oysters might become
acclimated, as it were, and their spawn, inheriting their parents'
acquired hardiness, we might present to the people of the State a
new form of Oregon product in the shape of Eastern oysters hatched
and grown in the waters of this bay. Notwithstanding the fecundity
of this oyster, a female producing in the vicinity of sixty million
eggs at a spawning, it must be remembered that even under
the most favorable conditions in its own home, where the water
has in summer a fairly constant temperature of over 70&deg; F. and
a salinity of 1.012 on an average, but a very small proportion of
this multitude survive. How much more unlikely is its survival
in the waters of Yaquina Bay, Oregon, where the writer has seen
the water change from a temperature of 70&deg; F. and a saltness of
1.012 to a temperature of 55&deg; and a salinity of 1.022 within six
hours! It was to save the young embryos from exposure to these
and kindred dangers that I, as a volunteer employee of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
States Fish Commission during the summers of 1897 and 1898,
among other things resorted to the artificial fertilization of the
eggs in a temporary laboratory, carrying the delicate embryos
to the swimming stage and dumping them by thousands into the
bay. Given some clean crocks, a microscope, dissecting instruments,
tumblers, rubber tubing, thermometers, and instruments
to test the saltness of the water, and innumerable embryos can be
cared for without much trouble. The process, as practiced by
Brooks, Ryder, Nelson, and others in America, is too well known
to need repeating here. Its efficacy is well established, and, in
spite of the incredulity of the oystermen, who wished to see the
oysters spawn "spontaneous," as they expressed it, an incredulity
amounting almost to opposition, the writer has persevered in this
work for two seasons and intends to continue it the coming summer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 666px;">
<img src="images/illo_101_nativeoyster.jpg" width="666" height="396" alt="" />
<span class="caption">1, native oyster spat on clam shell; 2, same on inside of oyster shell; 3, 4, 5, native spat (<i>Ostrea lurida</i>) on Eastern oyster shells; 6, showing size
and appearance of native spat one or two months old.</span>
</div>

<p>The native oyster of this Northwest coast (<i>Ostrea lurida</i>), smaller
and by many preferred to its Eastern congener, while it is far less
fruitful in its spawning than the latter, retains its young within the
parent shell until long after they have passed the tender stages,
when they leave the mantle cavity of the parent to swim for themselves.
This oyster could rightly be called viviparous, while the
Eastern oyster is oviparous. On account of its nurse-acting proclivities
this West-coast oyster has an immense advantage here over
the introduced species. The latter's eggs have to run the following
gantlet: (1) Not meeting with a fertilizing cell and perishing
in consequence; (2) sinking, before or after fertilization, in the
fatal mud; (3) being eaten by small fish and other minute animals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
(4) being killed by sudden changes in the temperature and density
of the water. Artificial fertilization and the rearing of the embryos
in the laboratory largely eliminate these dangers. We have
adopted other methods to insure success. A few of the oysters
were removed from the Government plant and deposited two miles
farther up the bay, nine miles and a half from the ocean, where
it was thought the water was warmer, less salt, and less variable
than on Oysterville Flat. Some, during the breeding season, were
placed on spawning floats and anchored near the shore, where the
shallow water is thoroughly warmed by the sun. It was in one of
these floats that the oystermen had an opportunity to see the oysters
spawn "spontaneous," for the water therein, reaching 70&deg; F., became
milk-white with spawn or milt within an hour after the
oysters had been taken from the plant. This was really our first
proof that the introduced oyster would spawn here. Some were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
placed in sloughs adjoining the bay, with the hope that favorable
conditions would be met with there. Others were placed in artificially
constructed salt ponds somewhat after the style used by the
French.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Eastern Oysters in Oregon.</span> The lower row shows size when planted in 1896; the
upper row represents their appearance in 1898.</span>
</div>

<p>What has been the outcome? The oysters, particularly the
Princess Bay variety, have grown enormously and are in excellent
condition. Until this spring no Eastern spat or young Eastern
oysters had been discovered; this, of course, is the crucial point
in the experiment; we know they will spawn, but will the spawn
develop? Recently, much to our encouragement, a few young
oysters, apparently of last summer's spawning, have been found
and forwarded to Washington, proof positive that the oyster will
propagate here, but not certain evidence of the practical outcome
of the experiment. It is too early to predict results as yet; two
years more are really required to tell the story.</p>

<p>For thirty years Eastern oysters have been shipped to San Francisco
by enterprising firms of that city, planted there in the bay
until a large size is attained, and then sold at an immense profit.
These firms have always claimed that the Eastern oyster did not
reproduce there. As far as can be ascertained from a reliable
source, the shipments in recent years have rather increased than
diminished, this fact being used as an argument to support the
above statement. It is nevertheless a known fact that much Eastern
spat and many adult oysters undoubtedly hatched there have
been found by members of the United States Fish Commission
and others. Moreover, with increasing trade one would naturally
expect more shipments, even though the introduced oyster did
propagate to some extent.</p>

<p><i>Ostrea lurida</i>, the toothsome little native oyster which years
ago was so abundant at Yaquina Bay, affording support to many
families, has decreased in numbers to such an alarming extent that
unless some radical measures are soon taken to prevent, the native
oyster industry of this locality will be a thing of the past. This
decrease in the size and numbers appears to be due to several
causes. In the first place, there has been a very persistent tonging
on a somewhat limited area. This might have been counterbalanced
by proper precautions to insure a future supply, but, with
characteristic lack of foresight, such precautions have been neglected,
and the beds have been culled year after year, until the
comparatively few oysters now marketed from Yaquina Bay are
of very questionable size. Each oysterman has two acres of flats
for private use. Three natural beds in the bay afford sources of
supply for these private beds. The larger oysters tonged on the
natural beds are marketed, and the smaller specimens spread on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the private ground referred to. Beyond strewing clean shells on
these private beds, no provision is made to collect the swimming
embryos during the spawning season, and multitudes must be carried
away and lost. The writer has urged upon the oystermen the
need of collectors of brush or tile, by the use of which the oysters
which they have acquired may be largely increased in numbers, and
will endeavor to demonstrate, by the use of tile collectors, that
hundreds of young spat may be saved and raised to marketable age.
Our native oyster structurally and physiologically resembles the
European oyster (<i>Ostrea edulis</i>), and, like it, could be propagated
in artificial oyster ponds. The practicability of such work on the
West American coast depends, of course, on the market price of
the resulting product as compared with the outlay required for
labor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>MALAY FOLKLORE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By R. CLYDE FORD.</span></p>


<p>The Malay is an Oriental, and, of course, possesses a goodly
number of superstitions and old wives' fables, but he does
not hug them to his soul like some of the other peoples of the
East&mdash;the Chinaman, for instance, who lives only by favor of
gods, ghosts, goblins, and devils. The Malay lives in spite of
spirits, good or bad, and tries to be a model Mohammedan at the
same time. With bold assurance and positiveness, he puts his trust
in Allah; but, after all, this does not keep him from cherishing,
on the sly, a knowledge of a few uncanny, hair-raising beliefs
any more than to be a devout churchman with us removes one
from the occult influences of stolen dishcloths, overturned saltcellars,
and the phases of the moon.</p>

<p>The Malay man's <i>aberglaube</i>&mdash;his superstition&mdash;is undoubtedly
of ancient origin. For five hundred years or more he has said
his prayers five times a day in response to the muezzin's cry of
<i>Allah ho akbar</i>, and his religion has penetrated the very life of his
race and spread to the most distant confines of the archipelago,
but it has never been able to remove entirely the heritage of that
past when he was governed by Sanskrit gods or by deities of his
own. Whatever he may have believed then and since changed,
these fragments and relics of goblindom and superstition go back
to that time, and so link on to all the weird love that prevailed
in the ancient world. Another evidence of the primitiveness of
Malay folklore may be seen in the fact that the inhabitants of
the jungles and <i>padangs</i> and the aboriginal dwellers of mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and dense forests cherish much more heathen notions and greater
elaborations of everyday superstitions than the more enlightened
and modernized Malays of towns and <i>campongs</i>. In the East, as
in the West, the man who lives close to Nature "holds communion
with her visible forms," and likewise finds out, or thinks he does,
a good deal about her invisible shapes.</p>

<p>The Malay has on his list of uncanny things the names of several
spirits. Disease is everywhere a great dread of men, and
often looked upon as an infliction of the supernatural powers.
There are several spirits of sickness recognized among the Malays,
but they reserve their greatest horror for the influences of the
<i>Hantu Katumbohan</i>, or spirit of smallpox. But other spirits
abound; there are some that inhabit the sources of streams, and
many that dwell in forests. Mines, too, have their patron goblins,
which are propitiated by the miners. The sea-going Malay,
also, whose vision has been clarified by bitter salt spray, knows
and frequently sees the spirits that inhabit certain parts of the
ocean.</p>

<p>The <i>Hantu Pemburo</i>, or phantom hunter, is a spirit the Malays
take special account of; in general, he seems to resemble the <i>wilde
J&auml;ger</i> of German folklore. Long ago, so the story has it, there
lived a certain man and his wife in Katapang, in Sumatra. One
day the wife fell sick, and, thinking the flesh of a mouse-deer
might strengthen her, she asked her husband to kill one for her.
He went forth on the hunt, but was unsuccessful and soon returned.
His wife now became very angry, and told him to try
again&mdash;in fact, not to return till he could come home with the
coveted game. The man swore a mighty oath, called his dogs,
took his weapons, and set out into the forest. He wandered and
wandered, and always in vain. The days ran into months, the
months became years, and still no mouse-deer. At last, despairing
of finding the animal on earth, he ordered his dogs to bay
the stars, and they sprang away through the sky, and he followed.
As he walked with upturned gaze, a leaf fell into his mouth and
took root there.</p>

<p>At home things were not going well. His son, born after his
departure, when he became a lad, was often taunted by the other
children of the <i>campong</i>, and twitted of the fact that his father
was a wandering ghost. After hearing the truth from his mother,
the boy went out into the forest to meet the huntsman. Far from
the haunts of men, in the depths of the forest, they met and conversed.
The boy told of his wrongs, and the father vowed to
avenge them, and ever since that time, say the Malays, he has
afflicted mankind. At night he courses through the wood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
sky with a noisy, yelping pack, and woe to the man who sees him!
On the peninsula the people mutter this charm to ward off his evil
influence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know thy history,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O man of Katapang!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore return thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy jungle of Mohang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do not bring sickness upon me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Malay is a firm believer in the efficacy of charms. He
wears amulets, places written words of magic in houses, and sports
a tiger's claw as a preventive of disease. If he is specially primitive
and backwoodsy, when he enters a forest he says: "Go to
the right, all my enemies and assailants! May you not look upon
me; let me walk alone!" To allay a storm he says: "The elephants
collect, they wallow across the sea; go to the right, go
to the left, I break the tempest." When about to begin an elephant
hunt, according to Thompson, he uses this charm: "The
elephant trumpets, he wallows across the lake. The pot boils, the
pan boils across the point. Go to the left, go to the right, spirit
of grandfather (the elephant); I loose the fingers upon the bowstring."</p>

<p>The Malay believes in witches and witchcraft. There is the
bottle imp, the <i>Polong</i>, which feeds on its owner's blood till the
time comes for it to take possession of an enemy. Then there is
a horrid thing, the <i>Penangalan</i>, which possesses women. Frequently
it leaves its rightful abode to fly away at night to feed
on blood, taking the form of the head and intestines of the person
it inhabited, in which shape it wanders around.</p>

<p>Such beliefs may perhaps have their origin in metempsychosis,
which in other ways has some foothold among the common people.
For instance, elephants and tigers are believed sometimes to be
human souls in disguise, and so the Malay addresses them as
"grandfather" to allay their wrath and avoid direct reference to
them. Crocodiles also are often regarded as sacred, and special
charms are used in fishing for them. One such, given by Maxwell,
is as follows: "O Dangsari, lotus flower, receive what I
send thee. If thou receivest it not, may thy eyes be torn out!"</p>

<p>The domestic animals also figure in Malay folklore. Dogs are
unlucky and regarded with suspicion, for they would like to lick
their master's bones. Cats, on the other hand, are lucky, and show
a fondness for their owners.</p>

<p>Owls are regarded as birds of ill omen, and their hooting forebodes
death.</p>

<p>Days are lucky and unlucky. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
are fortunate birthdays, and a dream on a Thursday night
will come true. To dream of a dog or a flood is unlucky. To
stumble when starting on a journey is a bad sign, and before setting
out on a pilgrimage to Mecca certain formulas are muttered
and signs followed.</p>

<p>The Malay hates to tear down a house, and so the old one is
left standing when a new one is built. The ladder of a house
must be built just so, or disaster comes to the owner or builder;
and to knock one's head on the lintel is regarded as unfavorable.
One rises quickly from a meal; otherwise, if he is single, he may
be regarded with disfavor by his prospective father-in-law.</p>

<p>As one travels over the archipelago he finds that superstitions
vary, and what may be regarded by the Malays of the peninsula
as particularly ominous may have no meaning at all with the
Malays of the south or east. The Dyaks of Borneo are probably
the most uncivilized of all the Malay tribes, for Mohammedanism
has taken but little hold upon them, and their natural paganism
remains as yet unshaken. Of their folklore we know but little.
It awaits the conquest of the West, like the island itself.</p>

<h2>ELECTRICITY FROM THALES TO FARADAY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ERNEST A. LESUEUR.</span></p>


<p>It is so common a notion nowadays that electricity had its birth
and rise in the nineteenth century that it gives one a strange
mental sensation to contemplate the fact that all the myriads of commercial
applications that have of late years been developed in this
field might have been made by the Chinese or the ancient Egyptians,
so far as the potentiality of Nature for developing electrical
phenomena is concerned. The writer used to know a delightful
old gentleman in Vermont who once referred, as to a well-known
fact, to Edison's having invented electricity. It is astonishing how
closely his state of mind typifies that of a great many people.</p>

<p>In the form of the lightning, the aurora, and the shock of the
electric eel or torpedo, electrical manifestations have been known
ever since man commenced to observe those phenomena, but the
fossil resin amber was the substance which eventually gave its name
to the now tremendous agency. This material was observed, many
centuries before our era, to possess the property of attracting light
bodies to itself when rubbed with wool, and, being called &#7972;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;
(electron) by the Greeks, transmitted its name to the property or
force which it thus brought into evidence. The fact is mentioned as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
early as 600 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, by Thales of Miletus, although he does not transmit
to us the name of the original observer of the phenomenon.
Homely as was the experiment, it marked a beginning in electrical
research.</p>

<p>Not that scientific investigations in that or any line were pushed
very assiduously in those days, for there is a great gap between the
discovery of the property above alluded to and the acquisition of
any more solid knowledge pertaining to electricity. The phenomenon
was at that time set down in the list of natural facts, and no
attempt appears to have been made to connect it with others. The
inquiring spirit of the present age can hardly be brought into more
striking relief than by a comparison of the, at present, almost daily
advances in scientific knowledge with the fact that twenty-two hundred
years elapsed between the discovery of the above-mentioned
power of amber by the ancients and the later one that a very large
number of other substances, such as diamonds, vitrefactions of all
kinds, sulphur, common resin, etc., possess the same property. A
few other scattered facts were, however, also noted by the ancients:
fire is said to have streamed from the head of Servius Tullius at the
age of seven, and Virgil asserts that flame was emitted by the hair of
Ascanius.</p>

<p>In examining, now, the history of the rise of electrical science
we find, as just mentioned, the vast gap of over two millenniums
between the discovery of the attracting power of rubbed amber and
the mere extension of man's knowledge so as to include other substances.
The philosophers Boyle and Otto von Guericke, who were
active during the latter half of the seventeenth century, added a
mass of new data in this line. Boyle, moreover, discovered the
equivalence of action and reaction between the attracting and the
attracted body, and that the rubbed amber or other "electric" retained
its attractive powers for a certain period after excitation had
ceased.</p>

<p>Otto von Guericke made a vast step forward by constructing the
first electrical machine, in a crude form, truly, but which proved of
the utmost service in adding to our knowledge of the properties of
electricity. His machine was constructed very simply of a globe of
sulphur mounted on a spindle, which could be rotated by means of a
crank; the operator applied friction with the hand, his body receiving
a positive charge, while the surface of the sulphur acquired a
negative. The fact of the two electrifications being separated at the
surface of the sulphur was not, however, known at the time; the
only charge that Guericke observed being that appearing on the
sulphur. The reason for this was that the latter, being a nonconductor,
any electricity generated upon it was compelled to stay there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
for a certain time at least, and consequently accumulated so as to
be observable; whereas the opposite electrification flowing into the
operator's hand continuously escaped to earth without giving any
sign of its presence. Had the operator stood upon an insulating support,
the electrification would have accumulated on his body as well
as upon the sulphur. Guericke made the discovery that a light body,
having been once attracted to an electrified surface, was almost immediately
repelled from it, and could not be again attracted without
having its imparted electrification removed by contact with an uncharged
surface.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, about 1675, made an interesting application
of a principle allied to this. He used a hollow, drum-shaped contrivance
with glass ends and a very short axis, into which he put a
number of fragments of paper. On briskly rubbing the outside of
the glass with a piece of silk the paper was caused to "leap from one
part of the glass to another and twirl about in the air." This was
repeated in 1676 before the Royal Society, to the great edification
of that learned body.</p>

<p>Newton made a considerable improvement in the electrical machine
of Guericke by the substitution of a hollow globe of glass for
Guericke's sulphur one. What is chiefly interesting about the improvement
is the fact that Guericke's sulphur globe, of comparative
weight and cumbrousness, was made by casting melted sulphur into a
glass globe and then breaking off the glass. Guericke observed in
the dark a peculiar luminosity of conducting surfaces when well
charged by means of his machine; he compared it to the phosphorescent
light observed when lump sugar is broken in the dark. It
was what is now known as the brush-discharge effect.</p>

<p>In 1705 Francis Hawksbee discovered the peculiar phenomenon
which he termed the mercurial phosphorus. It was produced by
causing a stream of well-dried mercury to fall through an exhausted
glass receiver. The friction of the particles of mercury against the
jet piece and the glass caused an electrification which evinced itself
in a phosphorescent glow. The receiver, indeed, had not to be by
any means thoroughly exhausted, the phenomenon occurring at an
air pressure up to about fourteen inches of the barometer.</p>

<p>The crackling noise and the spark accompanying electrical discharge
suggested about this time the analogy of those miniature disturbances
to thunder and lightning, but the identity of the two was
not fully established until later.</p>

<p>Up to this time the fact that certain substances were capable of
conducting electricity was not known, but in 1729 Stephen Gray,
F. R. S., an enthusiastic investigator, made the discovery, and at the
same time the cognate one that a large class of materials are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
nonconductors. The only source of electricity which was at the disposal
of experimenters up to this time was the electrical machine, improved,
as described, by Newton, which furnished intermittent currents (discharges)
of infinitesimal quantity, as we should say now, but of extremely
high pressure. This fact of the enormous pressure resulted
in the electricity's forcing its way through very imperfect conductors,
so as to cause our investigators to rank many of these latter with the
metals. Thus Gray concluded that pack thread was a good conductor
because it did not oppose sufficient resistance to prevent the
flow of his high pressure (or, as we should now say, high voltage or
tension) electricity. He tried wire as well, but did not realize it was
a better conductor than the thread, although its conductivity was
actually in the millions of times as great. In collaboration with his
friend Wheeler he conveyed electrical discharges a distance of eight
hundred and eighty-six feet, through presumably air-dry pack
thread&mdash;an achievement which would almost be notable at the
present time. He insulated the line by hanging it from loops of
silk thread.</p>

<p>Gray hoped "that there may be found out a way to collect a
greater quantity of electric fire, and consequently to increase the force
of that power, which, <i>si licet magnis componere parva</i>, seems to be
of the same nature with thunder and lightning."</p>

<p>About this time Desaguliers discovered that those materials
which, upon being rubbed, develop electrical charges, are all nonconductors,
and that, conversely, nonelectrics are conductors. The terms
electrics and nonelectrics were applied to bodies respectively capable
and incapable of excitation; the words idioelectrics and anelectrics
were also used in respectively equivalent senses.</p>

<p>In France, Dufay discovered that the conductivity of pack thread
was greatly improved by the presence of moisture, and he succeeded
in conveying a discharge a distance of almost thirteen hundred feet.
He suspended himself by silken cords and had himself electrified, and
then observed that he could give a shock accompanied by a spark to
any person standing on the ground.</p>

<p>He also established the fact of the two opposite kinds of electrification,
and gave them the names of vitreous and resinous, from the
fact that the former was developed by the excitation of glass and
vitreous substances generally, and the latter from that of amber
and resins. He observed that the distinguishing characteristic of
the two was the fact that opposite charges attracted each other, while
similar ones exerted mutual repulsion. Dufay and Gray died within
three years of each other, both at the age of forty, Gray having
added to the results already mentioned the discovery of the conducting
powers of certain liquids and of the human body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Experimental research now began to spread into Germany and
the Netherlands. The electrical machine was greatly improved by
Professor Boze, of Wittenberg, and Professor Winkler, of Leipsic,
who respectively added the prime conductor and the silk rubber to
that important piece of apparatus. A Scotch Benedictine monk of
Erfurt&mdash;Professor Gordon&mdash;substituted a glass cylinder for the
sphere, and thereby brought the instrument in its essentials practically
to the form in which it exists to-day. The improvement enabled
the production of very large sparks, which were caused to produce the
inflammation of various combustibles. Gordon went so far as to
ignite alcohol by means of a jet of electrified water.</p>

<p>We now come to an epoch-making discovery&mdash;that of the condenser,
or, in its conventional laboratory form, the Leyden jar. Professor
Muschenbroeck, of the University of Leyden, was struck with
the idea that it would be a good plan to try to prevent the dissipation
of the electric charge by inclosing the conductor containing it in an
insulating envelope. He therefore took a glass jar, partly filled it
with water, and electrified the latter. His assistant, who was holding
the bottle, accidentally touched the wire which made connection with
the water, and received on the instant a shock much more violent
than any that the electrical machine was capable of giving. This
led to the discovery that as the charge of vitreous electricity had
accumulated in the water, a corresponding charge of the opposite kind
had gathered upon the outside of the glass and been "bound" there,
as it is called, by the attraction exercised upon it by the charge on
the inside. It had been enabled to get upon the glass by the fact
of the assistant's hand having covered part of the surface of the
latter, and, since he stood upon the ground, the electricity had quietly
flowed from the latter up through his body to the outside surface of
the glass.</p>

<p>The apparatus was quickly perfected by coating both the inside
and outside of a jar with tin foil, applying the charge by means of a
wire or chain to the inside coating and allowing the outer one to
stand upon the earth or upon a conducting substance in electrical
contact with the latter. The exaltation of spirit with which the
discovery was hailed by the <i>savants</i> appears to have been extraordinary&mdash;one
student who took a discharge through his body being
reported to state that he would not have missed the experience
for a fabulous consideration, and that he would not repeat it if it
were to save his life. In reality the advance was enormous; it
gave a means for literally bottling up electricity in quantities previously
unthought of. The prime conductor of an electrical machine
could not retain any considerable quantity of electricity for the reason
that, a certain small intensity of electrification having been reached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the addition operated to upset the balance, so to speak, and the electricity
escaped by a sudden (disruptive) discharge, or spark, or by the
brush discharge already alluded to. With the Leyden jar, however,
as fast as electricity was supplied to the inside coating it became
"bound" there by the charge of opposite sign accumulating on the
outside, and the limit of capacity of the jar was simply one of strength
of the glass: if too much electricity was supplied, the stress of mutual
attraction between the two charges relieved itself by destroying
the jar.</p>

<p>Although Professor Muschenbroeck discovered the principle in
the manner above referred to, it appears extremely probable that
two other investigators, working independently, also did the same.
One Cuneus and a monk named Kleist each claimed the honor of
original invention of the condenser.</p>

<p>About 1747 the first gun was fired by electricity; this was accomplished
by Sir William Watson, who also succeeded in kindling
alcohol and gas by means of a drop of cold water and even with ice.
The same experimenter reversed the ordinary procedure of causing
the electric influence to pass from an electrified body to the one to
be experimented upon, the latter being unelectrified, by electrifying
the latter, and then producing the desired effect by approaching it to
an unelectrified one.</p>

<p>A party of the Royal Society with Watson as chief operator instituted
a series of researches on a grand scale to determine, if possible,
the velocity of the electric discharge, and arrived at a number
of conclusions which, however, were of a decidedly negative nature.
The most important of these were as follows: That they could not
observe any interval between the instant of applying the discharge
to one end of the line and its reception at the other; that the destructive
effects of discharge are greater through bad conductors than
through good ones; that conduction is equally powerful whether
occurring through earth or water.</p>

<p>Just previous to this there had been some brilliant experiments
carried on in France, and the discharge had been conveyed through
twelve thousand feet of circuit, including the acre basin of the Tuileries,
but they had not been performed as systematically, or with the
definite objects in view, as had the English experiments.</p>

<p>The following year the Royal Society continued its researches
on a larger scale than previously, using 12,276 feet of wire, and found
that even through that length the velocity was practically instantaneous.</p>

<p>Watson urged as a theory that electrical disturbances were caused
by influx or efflux of a single electric fluid from the state of normal
electrification, thus differing from Dufay in his opinion as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
existence of two fluids. He was led to this belief by observing that
he obtained a larger spark between two oppositely electrified bodies
than from either to the earth.</p>

<p>From this time on there appears upon the scene a host of workers
in this field, one of the most prominent being the distinguished
American, Benjamin Franklin. Somewhat previous to his remarkable
work, or about 1750, Boze made certain discoveries in the matter
of the surface tension of conducting liquids being diminished by electrification,
and Mowbray and Nollet ascertained that the vegetation
of flowers and of vegetating seeds was hastened by electrifying them.</p>

<p>Franklin (born 1706, died 1790) made the important discovery of
the active discharge of electricity from an electrified body by points
as well as the converse of it&mdash;i. e., that electricity was rapidly abstracted
from a charged atmosphere by points. This enabled him to
increase the efficiency of the electrical machine by adding a comb-shaped
series of points to the collector of the prime conductor.</p>

<p>Up to this time, although the identity of lightning with electricity
had long been suspected, it had not been at all established, and
to Franklin may be said to belong the honor of doing so, although
in this, as in the case of the invention of the Leyden jar, there appears
to have been successful contemporaneous research elsewhere. Before
performing his great experiment Franklin published a book
strongly supporting the belief in the identity of the two. Once
having conceived the idea of drawing electricity from the upper
atmosphere, he unfortunately lost some time through waiting for the
completion of the spire of a certain church in Philadelphia, from
the top of which he hoped to be able to collect electricity by means
of a wire, but finally hit upon the device which now fills much the
same place in connection with his memory that the classical cherry
tree does with Washington's&mdash;the lightning-collecting kite. This
apparatus was very simply constructed, and had a pointed wire projecting
a short distance above the framework. It was controlled,
and electrical connection made, by an ordinary string which terminated
in a short length of silk ribbon to protect the person from possible
injury, and to give electricity a chance to accumulate in the
system, by insulating the "line." At the end of the string proper
Franklin fastened a metallic key. In company with his son he flew
the kite during a thunderstorm which occurred in June, 1752; for
some time no electric disturbance approached the neighborhood, and
he was on the point of abandoning the experiment when he observed
what he had been waiting for&mdash;the outer fibers of the string standing
out from the latter by repulsive force&mdash;and, applying his knuckle
to the key, he drew a spark. Subsequently, when the rain soaked the
string and caused it to conduct much better, there was a fine supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
of electricity, and Franklin charged a Leyden jar from the key, thus
achieving the actual storage of "lightning."</p>

<p>He continued his investigations in atmospheric electricity, and
discovered that the electrification of the clouds (or of the upper
atmosphere) was sometimes positive and sometimes negative. The invention
of the lightning rod is due to him.</p>

<p>Franklin sided with Watson in his belief in the single nature of
the electric fluid.</p>

<p>As intimated above, atmospheric electricity appears to have been
collected independently about the same time in Europe, and certain
very daring and dangerous experiments were performed there. One
sad occurrence, as a result, was the death of Professor Richman, in
St. Petersburg, in 1753. Richman, in company with a friend, Sokolow,
was taking observations on an electroscope connected with an
iron rod which terminated in the apartment and extended in the
other direction above the roof of the building. During the progress
of their experiments a violent peal of thunder was heard in the neighborhood,
and Richman bent to examine the instrument. In doing
so he approached his head to within a foot of the end of the rod,
and Sokolow saw a ball of fire "about the size of a man's fist" shoot
from it to Richman's head with a terrific report. The stroke was, of
course, immediately fatal, and what we now know as the return shock
stupefied and benumbed Sokolow. The unfortunate event served as
a warning to other daring experimenters.</p>

<p>Canton, another prominent worker in this field, discovered that
the so-called vitreous electricity was not necessarily always developed
by the friction of glass, as had hitherto been believed to be invariably
the case. By applying different rubbers to glass he obtained either
positive or negative at pleasure. This at once disposed of the idea
that one kind of electricity resided in certain bodies and its opposite
in others. Canton also made the interesting discovery that glass,
amber, rock crystal, etc., when taken out of mercury, were all electrified
positively. He was thus enabled to make the improvement in
the electrical machine of coating its rubber with an amalgam rich in
mercury, which greatly enhanced its powers.</p>

<p>Among the numerous names now coming into prominence must
be mentioned those of Beccaria, Symmer, Delaval, Wilson, Kinnersley,
Wilcke, and Priestley.</p>

<p>The first named, Father Beccaria, was a celebrated Italian physicist
who did most valuable work in connection with atmospheric electricity,
and who published several classical works on that and allied
subjects. Among these may be mentioned his <i>Lettre del Elettricit&agrave;</i>,
1758, and <i>Experimenta</i>, 1772. He ascertained that water is
not by any means a good conductor, as it had previously been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
supposed to be, and, by using pure water, he caused the electric spark
to become visible in it, a phenomenon capable of occurring only
through media almost nonconducting. In these experiments he
used thick glass tubes with wires led through the opposite ends, the
latter being sealed, and the tubes filled with water. These were
invariably shattered by the passage of the spark on account of the
accompanying elevation of temperature, which caused expansion.
He also established the facts that the atmosphere adjacent to an
electrified body acquires electrification of the same sign by abstracting
electricity from the body, and that the air then parts with its
electricity very slowly. He advanced the theory that there is a
mutual repulsion between the particles of the electric fluid and
those of air, and that a temporary vacuum is formed at the moment
of the passage of a disruptive discharge or spark.</p>

<p>Robert Symmer, in 1759, described some most entertaining experiments,
making use of the opposite electrifications of superposed
stockings of different materials or merely of different colors (the dye
matters in the latter case causing differentiation). If, in a dry atmosphere,
a silk stocking be drawn over the leg and a woolen one pulled
over it, the two will be found, upon being removed, to be very powerfully
electrified in opposite senses. If the four stockings of two
such pairs be used and then suspended together, they will indulge
in remarkable antics due to each of the silk stockings trying to attract
both of the woolen ones, and <i>vice versa</i>, and, on the other hand, each
of each kind repelling the other. The amount of electrical attraction
and repulsion produced in this simple way in a dry atmosphere is
remarkable. The experiment may also be performed with all silk
stockings, one pair white and the other black.</p>

<p>Symmer advanced the theory of two fluids coexisting in all matter
(not independently of each other, as had been previously supposed),
which by mutual counteractions produced all electrical phenomena.
His conception was that a body, positively electrified, did not exist
in that condition because of the possession of a charge of a positive
(as distinct from a negative) electric fluid which it had not held before,
and did not hold in a normal state; nor that it possessed a
greater share of a single electric fluid than it did in an unelectrified
condition, as had been believed by Franklin and Watson, and by
Dufay respectively; but that such a body contained both positive
and negative electricities which, when the body behaved as "unelectrified,"
entirely counteracted each other, but which, on the
other hand, caused a positive or negative charge to be evinced should
either positive or negative electricity respectively preponderate.</p>

<p>&AElig;pinus was the author of another notable theory, of which we
must omit further mention for want of space.</p>

<p>Disjointed observations connected with animal electricity had
been accumulating for many centuries. The first chronicled note
that refers to the subject dates back to 676 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> Whether or
not entirely by chance, the Arabians named the electric eel, or torpedo,
in a way that impresses us now as singularly felicitous, <i>raad</i>
(the lightning). Toward the end of the last century Redi discovered
that the shock was sometimes conveyed through the line and rod to
the fisherman, and Kampfer compared the effects to those of electrical
discharges. It does not appear, however, that the resemblance was
actually believed to be more than accidental until Bancroft urged,
in the last ten years of the eighteenth century, the view which was
shortly proved. Investigation since has shown that several other
aquatic animals possess this astonishing manifestation of vitality,
notably the <i>Gymnotus electricus</i> (Surinam eel), the <i>Trichiurus electricus</i>,
and the <i>Tetraodon electricus</i>. Humboldt gives an account
of wonderful battles in South America between gymnoti and wild
horses. In fact, the most expeditious method, if not the most
humane one, of capturing these alarming creatures appears to be
to drive horses into the pond inhabited by them, and to allow the
eels to exhaust their strength by repeated electric discharges before
endeavoring to bring them to land by other means.</p>

<p>Cavendish was one of the most noted experimental investigators
in the electrical field during the latter third of the eighteenth century.
His work was remarkably accurate, considering the lack of a
proper equipment for taking observations incident to operations in
those days. He computed the relative conductivities of iron and
water as four hundred million to unity, and found that the addition
of but one part of common salt to one hundred of water increased the
conductivity of the latter a hundredfold. A twenty-six-per-cent solution
of salt he found to possess only seven and one quarter times the
conductivity of the extremely weak one mentioned. He also established
the law that the capacity of condensers (of which the previously
mentioned Leyden jar is an example) varies directly as the
active area, and inversely as the distance separating the conducting
surfaces. It was reserved for later investigators to make the grand
discoveries which relate to electrochemical dissociation, but Cavendish
succeeded in accurately determining the ratio of combination
of the elements of water in a method which superficially suggests
the inverse of electrolytic decomposition&mdash;i. e., by inducing the
combination of hydrogen and oxygen by the electric spark in the
instrument known as the eudiometer.</p>

<p>Hard on the heels of this work came news of Galvani's remarkable
discovery (1790) of the fact that freshly amputated frogs' legs,
on being touched along the lines of the muscles by dissimilar metals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
were powerfully agitated. We can only speak of this discovery as
the stumbling on to an isolated fact, for it was reserved for Volta
to establish the generalization that a current is produced in the conductor
joining dissimilar metals when the latter are both in contact
with a suitable electrolyte (or liquid capable both of conducting electricity
and of acting on one, and incidentally also sometimes both,
of the metals). Meantime (Du Bois-Reymond observes), "wherever
frogs were to be found, and where two different kinds of metal
could be procured, everybody was anxious to see the mangled limbs
of frogs brought to life in this wonderful way. Physiologists believed
that at last they should realize their visions of a vital power,
and physicians that no cure was impossible."</p>

<p>Volta first discovered merely the fact of electrification by contact.
He wrote to Galvani: "I don't need your frog. Give me two
metals and a moist rag, and I will produce your animal electricity.
Your frog is nothing but a moist conductor, and in this respect it is
inferior to my wet rag!" Nobili, nevertheless, in 1825 proved the
existence of galvanic currents in muscles.</p>

<p>Later on Volta invented the "<i>couronne des tasses</i>" (crown
of cups), thus at the same time adopting the general form of cell
used, with modifications, to-day, and producing the higher electromotive
force, or electrical pressure, consequent on the multiplication
of the cells in a series battery.</p>

<p>Just before Volta's celebrated communication to the Royal Society,
in 1800, Fabroni, of Florence, in discussing Galvani's phenomenon,
went to the root of the matter by suggesting that the energy of
chemical action was at the bottom of galvanic manifestations, and he
was warmly upheld in this contention by Sir Humphry Davy, who,
upon the publication of Volta's discoveries, constructed a most
elaborate battery with which (apparently about 1806) he produced
the arc light between carbon pencils.</p>

<p>In the year referred to, Davy published the results of a series
of experiments of enormous significance, among other things of
the isolation of the alkali metals, sodium and potassium, whose
existence had hitherto not been dreamed of. The simple electrolytic
decomposition of water had been accomplished by Nicolson
and Carlisle in the last year of the eighteenth century. Sir W. S.
Harris says: "A series of new substances was speedily discovered,
the existence of which had never before been imagined. Oxygen,
chlorine, and acids were all dragged, as it were, to the positive pole,
while metals, inflammable bodies, alkalies, and earths became determined
to the negative pole of the battery. When wires connected
with each extremity of the new battery were tipped with prepared
and well-pointed charcoal, and the points brought near each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
then a most intense and pure evolution of light followed, which on
separating the points extended to a gorgeous arc." It was at first
supposed that the galvanic or voltaic electricity was distinct from
the so-called "frictional" or "ordinary" electricity.</p>

<p>A distinguished contemporary of Cavendish was Coulomb, the
value of whose work in developing certain exceedingly important
mathematical laws with regard to action at a distance, surface densities,
and rates of charge dissipation can hardly be overestimated.
His name was given to the torsion balance which, since his day, has
been the standard instrument for measuring electric and magnetic
attractions and repulsions. The importance of his work has since
been recognized by the perpetuation of his name in connection with
the unit of quantity of electricity, as that of Volta has been honored
by its use, abbreviated (volt), to designate the unit of electrical
tension or pressure.</p>

<p>Certain highly instructive and interesting data were accumulated
about this time by Volta, Laplace, Saussure, and the renowned
chemist Lavoisier, in connection with the subject of electrification
produced when evaporation, and the liberation of gases and vapors in
general from any cause, occurs. The liquid, solid, or mixture liberating
the gas was contained in a metallic dish and the resultant electrification
of the latter examined qualitatively. Volta's observations
led him to conclude that the electrification was always negative, but
Saussure demonstrated finally that its sign was dependent on the material
of the dish. These experimenters covered, between them all,
a somewhat extensive field, examining, among other things, the
electrification resulting from the ebullition of various liquids, from
the ordinary combustion of fuel, and from the decomposition of acids
by metals to liberate hydrogen.</p>

<p>About the end of the first decade of the century Poisson attacked
the phenomena of electricity analytically, and succeeded in demonstrating
the right of electrical investigation to rank among the exact
sciences. Of his most important mathematical propositions is one
in which, assuming as a working hypothesis the existence of two
mutually attracting fluids, he deduced formul&aelig; covering the distribution
of these fluids on the surfaces of two conducting spheres, in or
out of contact.</p>

<p>A great deal of work was done during the end of the last century
and the beginning of the present one on what is now known
as pyro-electrification. The Abb&eacute; Ha&uuml;y discovered that fragments
of tourmaline crystal exhibited opposite electrifications on opposite
extremities of their lines of cleavage. It is this crystal also which has
unusually remarkable powers of polarizing light, and which, under
electro-magnetic stress, suffers modifications of the latter property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Ha&uuml;y investigated the field with much diligence, and succeeded in
cataloguing a large number of natural crystals by the side of tourmaline.
The subject was amplified later by Sir David Brewster, who
added a series of artificial crystalline salts to the list of pyro-electrical
materials, among them, notably, hydro-potassic (and sodic) tartrate.
The property was found not always to reside on these substances, but
to be developed by heating them. Brewster found that even powdered
tourmaline exhibited opposite electrifications on the opposite
extremities of each tiny particle, causing the latter to act, so far as
attractions and repulsions went, as infinitesimal magnets.</p>

<p>Our rapid and imperfect survey has now brought us to the
threshold of the great activity in electrical work elicited by the tremendous
discovery, made by Professor Oersted, of Copenhagen, of
the existence of the electro-magnetic field. It happens that two of
the most amiable and estimable individuals that have ever devoted
their lives to scientific research stand out in this connection head and
shoulders above all other investigators&mdash;Amp&egrave;re and Faraday, the
latter sixteen years younger than the former and destined to long
survive him.</p>

<h2>WINGLESS BIRDS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By PHILIPPE GLANGEAUD.</span></p>


<p>It is often said that there are no rules without exceptions. We
purpose to test the truth of this maxim once more. Fishes are
made to live in water, but some of them pass the greater part of
their existence in mud. Some even perch upon trees, thus competing
with birds, whose kingdom is the air, and which are able,
with the aid of their wings, to plunge into space and travel rapidly
over considerable distances. Yet there are birds, deprived by
Nature, which do not possess the wing characteristic of the feathered
tribe, and are consequently, like the majority of animals,
pinned to the soil.</p>

<p>Birds do not all have equal power of flight, which is closely related
to the extent of the development of their wings. There exist
all grades in the spread of wings between that of the condor, which
is four times the length of the body, whereby the bird is able to
rise to the height of nearly twenty-five thousand feet, and the
little winglets of the auk, which are of no use to it. The penguins
have still smaller wings, which are nothing more than short,
flattened stumps, without proper feathers and covered with a fine,
hairlike down which might be taken for scales.</p>

<p>Another group of birds exists, called appropriately <i>Brevipennes</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the wings of which are so poorly developed as to be wholly unsuitable
for flight. As an offset and just compensation for this, their
long and robust legs permit them to run with extraordinary speed.
For that reason they have been called running birds, in distinction
from other kinds that constitute the group of flying birds. Among
them are some gigantic birds, and also some that have no visible
wings on the outside of their bodies, and may therefore be properly
called wingless.</p>

<p>The ostrich is a member of this group. With its bare, callous
head and short bill, its long, featherless neck, and its massive body,
supported by long, half-bare legs, ending in two large toes; its very
short wings, formed of soft and flexible feathers; and its plume-shaped
tail, it presents a very special appearance among the birds.</p>

<p>The nandous, the American representatives of the ostrich, have
still shorter wings, which have no <i>remigia</i> at all, and terminate in
a horny appendage, and they have no tail feathers.</p>

<p>The cassowary and the emu also resemble the ostrich in many
points, but their wings are still more reduced than those of the
nandou. They are only slightly distinct, and can not be seen when
the bird holds them close up to its body. In the <i>Apteryx</i>, the
name of which, from the Greek, means without wings, the organs
of flight are hardly apparent, and consist simply of a very short
stump bearing a thick and hooked nail. The <i>Apteryx</i>, which is
also called <i>Kiwi</i>, a native of New Zealand, is the most singular of
living birds. The neck and the body are continuous, and the
moderately sized head is furnished with a long beak resembling
that of the ibis. Having long hairs similar to the mustaches of
cats at its base, it is different from the bills of all other existing
birds in possessing nostrils that open at its upper point. Although
the <i>Apteryx</i> can not fly, it runs very fast, despite the shortness of
its legs, and can defend itself very effectively against assailants
by the aid of its long-nailed and sharp-nailed feet. The tail is
absent like the wings. The very pliant feathers are extremely
curious, of the shape of a lance-head, pendent, loose, silky, with
jagged barbs, and increase in length as they go back from the
neck. The bird is of the size of a fowl, and when in its normal
position stands with its body almost vertical, and carries the suggestion
of a caricature&mdash;resembling, we might say, a feathered sack,
with only a long-billed head and the claws projecting, and one beholding
it feels that he is looking at some unfinished creature. It
is a nocturnal bird, of fierce temper, and has become rare in consequence
of the merciless war that is made upon it. Everything
is strange about it, even the single egg it lays, which weighs about
a quarter as much as its body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Together with the <i>Apteryx</i>, there lived in New Zealand a bird
that reached the height of nearly twelve feet&mdash;the <i>Dinornis</i>. It
and the <i>Phororhaces</i> and the <i>Brontornis</i>, which have been recently
exhumed in Patagonia, might be regarded as the giants of birds.
This bird was known to the natives as the <i>Moa</i>, and lived in troops
like the ostriches. Its organization was very much like that of the
<i>Apteryx</i>, from which it was, however, distinguished by its great size,
long neck, and short beak. It seems to have had the aspect of an
ostrich, with a feathered neck and no wings or tail. The feet of
the <i>Dinornis</i>, with their three large toes, were really enormous.
Isolated fragments of its bones suggest very large mammals, rather
than birds. The femur and tibia are larger than those of a bear,
the tibia alone being about four feet long, and the thickness, in the
narrowest part, of the width of a man's hand, while it was more
than seven inches in the thickest part. The sternum, on the other
hand, was small, convex, and longer than broad. The wing could
not have been visible on the outside of the body, for the bones that
constitute them are proportionally smaller than those of the <i>Apteryx</i>.
There was, therefore, a maximum reduction of the wing in
this bird.</p>

<p>The <i>Dinornis</i> was covered with a rich plumage, and this was
doubtless what led to its destruction, women preferring its plumes
to all other ornaments. The large number of bones which have
been discovered in the alluviums, the caves, and the peat bogs of
New Zealand authorize the thought that the island was once inhabited
by a considerable number of these birds, which were able
easily to repel the attacks of other animals by means of their big
feet. But they could stand no chance against Nature's more terrible
destroyer&mdash;man&mdash;who, when seeking the gratification of his
taste and fancy, does not hesitate to exterminate whole species.
The natives of New Zealand still recall the history of these singular
birds; their extermination seems to have occurred about the time
the island was visited by Captain Cook (1767-1778). Moreover,
some of the bones collected in later years still had animal matter
upon them. Even parts of the windpipe have been discovered,
mixed with charcoal, and evidences of cooking have been found.</p>

<p>A near relative of the <i>Dinornis</i>, which the Maoris regard as
extinct, is the <i>Notornis</i>, of which only four living specimens have
been found since 1842, the last one having been captured in the
latter part of 1898.</p>

<p>The eggs of the <i>Dinornis</i> were very large, having a capacity
of about a gallon and being equivalent to eighty hen's eggs. Still
larger eggs than these, however, are known. In 1851 Isidore
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire exhibited, in the French Academy of Sciences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
eggs of a bird coming from Madagascar that had a capacity
of two gallons. Some specimens of these eggs may be seen in the
galleries of the Paris Museum, and still larger eggs have been
found. The museum in London has one with a capacity exceeding
eleven quarts, or equivalent to two hundred and twenty hen's
eggs, or more than seventy thousand humming birds' eggs. It was
thought at first that the bird which laid these gigantic eggs was
still living, for natives of Madagascar spoke of having seen a bird
of colossal size that could throw down an ox and make a meal of
it. Such, however, were not the ways of the bird called the
<i>Epiornis</i>, which had no talons or wings, and fed on vegetable substances.
The description by the celebrated traveler Marco Polo
of a great flying bird of prey, called a roc, has no reference to the
<i>Epiornis</i>. M. Grandidier has demonstrated that this bird no longer
exists in Madagascar, and that if man ever knew it the stories with
marvelous details which the savages hand down from generation
to generation make no mention of it. We owe to M. Grandidier,
M. Milne-Edwards, and Major Forsyth what is known of the history
of this large wingless bird, which resembles the <i>Dinornis</i> in
several points. If its size was proportioned to that of its eggs it
should have been twice as large as the <i>Dinornis</i>. It was not, however,
but constituted a family represented by very diverse forms
and of variable size, though never much exceeding eleven feet.
The head was similar in appearance to that of the <i>Dinornis</i>, but
the surface of the forehead was furrowed with wrinkles and cavities,
indicating the presence of a crest of large feathers. A curious
peculiarity was the opening of the Eustachian tube directly on
the exterior. The cervical vertebr&aelig; are very numerous, while the
sternum is much reduced. It is a flat bone, broad but very short,
especially in the median part. The wing also has suffered a great
regression, for it comprises only a thin, short rod, the humerus,
and a small osseous mass representing all the other bones of the
wing stuck together. The <i>Epiornis</i> had no wings externally visible.
The bones of the feet were, on the other hand, of considerable
size, and indicate that the bird that possessed them was larger
than the <i>Dinornis</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Epiornis</i>, according to M. Milne-Edwards, frequented the
borders of waters, keeping among the reeds along lakes and rivers,
for its bones are found associated with those of turtles, crocodiles,
and a small hippopotamus. It most probably nested in the low
plains around lakes.</p>

<p>Just as the <i>Apteryx</i> among birds, and the bison and the beaver
among mammals, so the <i>Dinornis</i> and the <i>Epiornis</i> have been destroyed
as man has extended his abode and his domination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>When we regard the fauna of Madagascar and of New Zealand
we are struck by the great resemblance between them, from the
points of view of their recent and ancient vertebrate fauna. These
resemblances suggest the past existence of relations between these
two lands now separated by a wide expanse of sea, and this agrees
with geological observations.&mdash;<i>Translated for the Popular Science
Monthly from La Nature.</i></p>

<h2>SKETCH OF FREDERICK C. SELOUS.</h2>


<p>The description of Selous, in Men and Women of the Time,
as "explorer, naturalist, and sportsman," is suggestive of the
manner in which his career has been developed and his fame has
grown. Beginning his active life as a mere hunter of big game in
the wilds of South Africa, and known at first only as a sportsman,
he has become recognized as one of the leading, most intelligent,
and most efficient explorers of his time, and is accepted as the most
eminent authority respecting what relates to the large and important
region of Mashonaland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick Courtenay Selous</span> was born in London, the son of
a father of Huguenot extraction and of a mother who, descended
from the Bruces of Clackmannan, could count Robert Bruce among
her ancestors, and was also related to Bruce, the Abyssinian traveler.
He was taught at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, and then went
to school at Rugby, where he distinguished himself by his activity,
which was displayed in his high spirits and love of violent mischief
and by his personal courage to such an extent that his schoolfellows
wittily nicknamed him "Zealous."</p>

<p>Leaving Rugby when sixteen or seventeen years old, he spent
two years in Switzerland and Germany, studying at Neufch&acirc;tel and
Wiesbaden. His hardy activity seems to have been as marked in
Germany as at Rugby, for it is recorded of him that he attracted
some notice in the papers by jumping into the Rhine in winter
after a wild duck which he had shot. He was not dressed for a
swim, and, his great coat and top boots becoming filled with water,
he had much difficulty in getting to shore with his game. His determination
to achieve a career in South Africa by hunting and
collecting specimens was apparently reached while he was still
a youth, and at nineteen years of age he sailed from England, to
land at Algoa Bay in 1871. Hunting was his object, as is substantially
confessed in the title of his first book, A Hunter's Wanderings
in Africa. The book won instant recognition as a story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
sport and a hunter's prowess, and was regarded in that light by the
critics and the general public. The Royal Geographical Society,
however, perceived other qualities in the story he had to tell, and
gave him successively honorable mention, the Cuthbert Peake
grant, and, in 1883, the Founder's Gold Medal, the highest honor
it had to bestow.</p>

<p>Among the earliest testimonials paid by this society to the value,
as yet not generally appreciated, of Selous's work was that given
by Lord Aberdare, president, in his anniversary address, delivered
in May, 1881, to the services rendered to geography in the regions
west of Lake Nyassa by Mr. Selous, who had "hitherto been known
as a mighty hunter of large game.... This gentleman, we learn,
in 1878 penetrated for one hundred and fifty miles the unknown
country north of the Zambezi, in the direction of Lake Bangweolo.
He has since crossed in various directions the Matabele country
south of the Zambezi, discovering two new rivers and defining the
course of others which had previously been laid down from vague
information." Selous's Notes on the Chobi, it appears, had already
been published by the Geographical Society.</p>

<p>Mr. Selous has spent most of his time since he began his African
wanderings in 1871, except for occasional visits to England, in
traveling and hunting over that part of the African continent with
which his name as an explorer is associated. In 1877 he and
some companions penetrated into Matabeleland to hunt elephants.
Relating the story of his wanderings in an address to the Royal
Geographical Society in 1893, he described his experiences with
fever and ague, the attacks of which began in Griqualand in 1872,
but came on only when he halted anywhere a few days. North
of the Zambezi he made several journeys among the Balongas,
and spent a wretched rainy season, almost without equipment,
on the Manica table-land, of the luxuriant vegetation of which,
with sweet-smelling flowers after the rains, he gave a glowing description
in his address. Interesting observations were made on
some of the northern rivers. The curious phenomena of the steady
rise of the waters of the Chobi and Machabi&mdash;an outlet of the
Okavango&mdash;was observed from the first week in June till the last
week in September, when the flood began to recede.</p>

<p>From 1882 the journeys acquired additional geographical importance,
and Mr. Selous proceeded to rectify the maps of Mashonaland
made by earlier travelers, taking constant compass bearings,
sketching the courses of rivers, and fixing the positions of
tributaries. The value of this work was made manifest in a magnificent
large scale map of the country.</p>

<p>This map, which was published in 1895, was intended, first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
chiefly, to illustrate the work done by Mr. Selous while in the
service of the South African Company; and, secondly, to embody,
as far as possible, the knowledge possessed of the entire region
extending from Fort Salisbury to the northward as far as the Zambezi,
and to the eastward as far as the lower Pungwe. Mr. Selous's
manuscript originals, deposited in the map room of the Royal Geographical
Society, comprise a compass survey, showing the routes
during a year's employment in the service of the British South
African Company, September 1, 1890, to September, 1891, on a
scale of 1:255,000; a sketch map, showing the route of the Manika
Mission from Fort Charter to Umtassa's and thence to the
camp near Mount Wedza, and also the routes taken by Mr. Selous
from the camp near Mount Wedza to Makoni's, Mangwendi's, Maranka's,
and back to Makoni's, on a scale of 1:255,000; a sketch
of routes from Umtali to Mapanda (Pungwe) and back, in 1891,
on the same scale; a sketch of Mashonaland, showing tribal boundaries,
on the same scale; a rough survey map of the countries
ruled over by the Makorikori chiefs, for which a mineral concession
had been granted to the Selous Exploration Syndicate, on a
scale of 1:210,000; and about thirty sheets of manuscript maps
and rounds of angles, utilized in the compilation of the first four
maps of this list.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Selous did not determine latitudes or longitudes,
his long-distance compass bearings enabled him to lay down a network
of triangles connecting Fort Salisbury with Masikesi. These
triangles included Fort Charter, Sengedza, and Mavanka's in the
south, Mount Mtemwa in the north, and Mount Dombo in the
east; and it turns out that the distance between Fort Salisbury and
Masikesi, as resulting from this triangulation, differs to the extent
of only about a mile from that obtained by careful astronomical
observations made at the two terminal points. The greater part
of Mr. Selous's compass bearings were taken during the rainy
season, when the air was very clear and landmarks could be seen
at great distances. Mr Selous's determinations of altitude were
not so accurate, and those obtained with the aneroid were characterized
by himself as "of little value."</p>

<p>During all of his twenty years' wanderings Mr. Selous represented
in his address to the Royal Geographical Society, with the
exception of a treacherous night attack made upon his camp by
the Mashuku-Sumbwe, led by a few hostile Marotse, in 1888, he
had never had any serious trouble with the natives. He had gone
among many tribes who had never previously seen a white man,
and was always in their power, as he seldom had more than from
five to ten native servants, none of whom were ever armed. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Selous's pioneer work began in 1889, when he conducted a gold-prospecting
company through eastern Mashonaland. The journey
took the party to the Portuguese settlements on the Zambezi,
where those people were found to have a full appreciation of the
richness of the gold region.</p>

<p>The British South Africa Company, or "Chartered Company,"
as it is sometimes called, was incorporated about the same time
(October, 1889), with power to occupy and possess the large domains
that constitute what is now called Rhodesia. The return
of Mr. Selous to the Cape of Good Hope with the report of what
he had observed had the effect of determining the company to speed
its operations so as to anticipate the Portuguese. Mr. Selous entered
the service of the company, and, although he was not yet an
explorer in the scientific sense, the accurate memory of his early
wanderings over the region enabled him to guide successfully the
pioneer expedition that took possession of Mashonaland.</p>

<p>One of the sensational incidents of this campaign was the refusal
of Lobengula to allow the pioneer force to use the road that
led through Buluwayo, his capital, the only existing wagon road
from the British frontier to the Mashonaland plateau. A new
road was cut, under the guidance and superintendence of Mr. Selous,
through four hundred and sixty miles of wilderness, the whole
work being accomplished in two months and a half.</p>

<p>Among the chiefs who submitted to the British occupation
after the seizure of Gonvola was Moloko, ruler of the country
north of Manica, who made a treaty with Mr. Selous. After two
years spent in various operations for opening up the country and
securing treaties with the native chiefs, Mr. Selous returned to England
in December, 1892, and put the narrative of his adventures
to press, but was called back in August, 1893, returning at very
short notice, on account of the threatening attitude of the Matabele
chief Lobengula and the consequent risk of interruption in the
development of the country. The tribes had risen against the
assumption of the company to claim as a territorial cession what
they had regarded as simply a grant of mining and exploiting privileges.
Mr. Selous engaged actively in the campaign, in which he
is credited with having fought with great gallantry by the side of
the colonists, and was wounded while protecting some negroes who
had been surprised by the enemy.</p>

<p>Returning again to Mashonaland, he reached there in time to
witness a second outbreak of the natives, vexed by the triple plague
of locusts, rinderpest, and the stringent regulations of the Chartered
Company's government with respect to cattle. His own cattle
were stolen, and he headed a company of volunteers that went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
out to check the insurgents and protect the people who were still
on their farms.</p>

<p>The fruits, in acquisition to geographical knowledge, of Mr.
Selous's adventures and explorations are to be found, mingled with
much about sporting and exciting incident, in his books: A Hunter's
Wanderings in South Africa, already mentioned; Travel and
Adventure in Southeast Africa (1893); Sunshine and Storm in
Rhodesia (1896); and in lectures to the Geographical Society and
periodical contributions concerning Mashonaland.</p>

<p>These books abound in observations on natural history, often
constituting real contributions of new facts or new demonstrations
to the science, usually occurring incidentally in the narrative of
adventure, but sometimes given in more formal shape. The author
avows that his conclusions respecting animals are drawn from personal
experience of the beasts, and are not influenced in any way by
the stories of old hunters, Dutch or native. Among these notices
are original observations on the giraffe and its habits, notes on
buffaloes and their disposition, and remarks on variations in the
types of South African lions. Of this animal, while some authors
would make three species, the author believes there is only one.
"As out of fifty male lion skins," he says, "scarcely two will be
found exactly alike in the color and length of the mane, I think
it would be as reasonable to suppose there are twenty species as
three." So in Notes upon South African Rhinoceroses, a paper
read before the Zo&ouml;logical Society of London in June, 1881, and
reprinted in this volume, Mr. Selous gives his reasons for affirming
that there are only two species of rhinoceros in South or in
all Africa&mdash;the square-mouthed or white <i>Rhinoceros simus</i> and
the prehensile-lipped or black <i>Rhinoceros bicornis</i>&mdash;while the supposed
<i>Rhinoceros keitloa</i>, or blue rhinoceros of the Boers, is merely
a variety of the <i>bicornis</i>, the distinction between the two being
based only on differences in the relative length of the horns. Another
paper from the Proceedings of the Zo&ouml;logical Society, reprinted
here, is Notes on the South Central African Antelopes, embodying
again only the results of the author's own observations.
In this paper twenty-two species are described by their scientific,
native, Dutch, and English names, and their characteristics, habits,
appearance, and distinctions are indicated.</p>

<p>In the preface to his Travel and Adventure in Southeast Africa
Mr. Selous tells how he had determined, in 1881, upon visiting the
ostrich farm of his friend Frank Mandy, to settle down in Africa
for a quiet life. Then he went home and spent a few months in
England. Visiting the Natural History Department of the British
Museum, he was shown by Dr. Gunther and his associate how old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and dilapidated some of the specimens were, and how many noble
forms were not represented at all. He took note of what he ought
to get should he visit the interior of Africa again. Next we find
him in South Africa, not quiet on a farm as he had intended to be,
but in the wilderness, where he spent six years (1882-'87) engaged
principally in collecting specimens "of the magnificent fauna which
once abounded throughout the land," but many forms of which
were now becoming scarce and some were verging on extinction.
He shot and preserved a great many fine specimens of the larger
antelopes, some of which may be seen in the New Natural History
Museum at South Kensington, while others are in the collection
of the South African Museum at Cape Town. Besides the stories
of specimen hunting and adventures with the lions that are always
to be found where game is abundant, the volume contains much
matter of more general interest, such as notes of personal experiences
among the Boers; accounts of two expeditions sent against
the Batauweni by Lobengula; the devastations committed by the
Matabele in Mashonaland; valuable notes on the Bushmen or Masarwas;
accounts of journeys beyond the Zambezi to the countries
of the Machukulumbwi and Barotsi tribes; and a review of the past
history and present condition of Mashonaland. We find here also
a notice of the caves of Sinola, with a subterranean lake in the
principal cave having water marked by a deep-blue color like that
of the blue grotto of Capri, an account of which was published by
Mr. Selous in the Proceedings of the Geographical Society of London
for May, 1888. An account of Mr. Selous's Twenty Years in
Zambezia was published in the Geographical Journal in 1893.</p>

<p>Mr. Selous has done more than any other man to bring Mashonaland
into notice, and is credited, together with Cecil Rhodes,
with having contributed most to the creation of Rhodesia. The
first comprehensive account of Mashonaland was given by him in
the Fortnightly Review for May, 1889, when he described the
country as a land of perennial streams in which thirst is an unknown
quantity; with its high plateau, standing at an elevation of
from four thousand to forty-six hundred feet and forming a very
important watershed, endowed with a network of important
streams, the springs supplying which, welling out from the highest
parts of the downs, were capable of being applied to the irrigation
of an enormous area, and having a salubrious climate, the continuous
southwest wind giving cool breezes in summer and cold ones
in winter. The high plateaus were further of much ethnological
interest, in that they gave shelter to the very few remnants of the
peaceful Mashonas who had escaped extermination at the hands
of the Matabele.</p>

<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<h3><i>SCIENCE AND THE SCIENTIFIC MIND.</i></h3>

<p>The address delivered by Prof.
Michael Foster, as president
this year of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science,
was not as long or elaborate as such
addresses are wont to be, but it
contained many thoughts of great
value. After sketching the vast advances
in scientific knowledge made
within the present century, he observed,
with great truth, that "the
very story of the past which tells of
the triumphs of science puts away
all thoughts of vainglory." Why?
In the first place, because no one
can study the history of science
without being made to feel how
very near, in many cases, the men
of the past came to anticipating
some of the most famous discoveries
and generalizations of later
years. Translate the language of
an earlier age into modern terms,
and you often find that you have expressed
the most advanced scientific
doctrine of to-day. In the second
place, if we find a certain lack of
definiteness and truth to fact in the
ideas of the past, how can we be
at all sure how <i>our</i> ideas will look
when confronted with the fuller
knowledge which doubtless our successors
will possess? Lastly, "there
is written clearly on each page of
the history of science the lesson that
no scientific truth is born anew,
coming by itself and of itself. Each
new truth is always the offspring of
something which has gone before,
becoming in turn the parent of
something coming after." However
great the work of a man of
science may be, "it is not wholly
his own; it is in part the outcome
of the work of men who have gone
before." In this respect Professor
Foster sees a striking difference between
the man of science and the
poet. We always know whence the
former came, but the latter is almost
as devoid of visible ancestry
as Melchizedek. When the man of
science dies the results which he
achieved remain, and his work is
taken up where he left it off; whereas
the poet, strictly speaking, has no
continuators. The Homerid&aelig; do
not represent Homer, nor do Dryden
and Congreve take the place of
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The story of natural knowledge
or science, we are reminded, is a
story of continued progress. "There
is in it not so much as a hint of
falling back&mdash;not even of standing
still." The enemies of science
sometimes seek to turn against it
the fact that each age revises the
conclusions of the preceding one.
They ask, What dependence can be
placed upon opinions or theories
that are thus subject to change?
The answer is that the science of
each age is the nearest approximation
which that age can make to the
truth, and upon some points represents
the truth with a great approach
to finality of interpretation.
The law of gravitation, for example,
as formulated by Newton, lies at
the foundation of the physics of to-day.
The circulation of the blood
was discovered once for all by Harvey.
The true theory of the solar
system was given once for all by
Kepler. It is the glory of science
that whatever of imperfection may
lurk in a scientific theory is sure
to be brought to light and corrected
by subsequent observation
and analysis.</p>

<p>The learned professor dwelt
briefly but forcibly upon the qualities
of the scientific mind. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
first place, the scientific mind must
"vibrate in unison with that of
which it is in search." It is in
search of truth, and it must therefore
vibrate in unison with truth.
The follower of science must have a
truthfulness beyond that of the ordinary
man, who does not set a great
price upon exactness in his observations
or conclusions, and readily
confounds things which, superficially
similar, are fundamentally different.
Nature resents even the most
trifling inexactness, and the careless
student will find that the further
he carries his inquiries the further
he goes astray. The scientific
mind must also be alert. The indications
and hints which Nature
gives are sometimes very slight, and
only one who is watchful in the extreme
and attentive to the smallest
things will catch them. Then the
problems which Nature sets are
often complicated, and call for a
high degree of courage and perseverance.
An inquiry which seemed
easy at first will suddenly become
overcast by what seems the most
hopeless obscurity, and the scientific
worker, unless he possesses the
necessary moral as well as intellectual
qualities, will fail in his
quest. Considering the characteristics
which the pursuit of science
tends to develop in its votaries, and
considering that scientific method
is now and has been for many years
past a wonderfully devised system
for carrying on research, Professor
Foster is surprised that the progress
of science is not even more rapid
than it is. He fears that perhaps
Science does not get the best minds
enrolled in her service, and rather
hints that our institutions of education
are responsible for turning
aside many who might lend great
aid in the advancement of real
knowledge to less profitable pursuits.
In words of almost precisely
similar import to some that we used
in these columns not very long ago,
he observes that "that teaching is
one-sided, and therefore misleading,
which deals with the doings of
man only and is silent about the
works of Nature, in the sight of
which he and his doings shrink
almost to nothing." The whole
address is stamped with the high
thoughtfulness which so eminently
distinguishes its author, and deserves
to be carefully pondered by
all who would understand the character
and mission of science and
the intellectual needs of the present
age.</p>


<h3><i>THE LATE WILLIAM H. APPLETON.</i></h3>

<p>As many of our readers will have
learned through the daily press, Mr.
William H. Appleton, long the head
of the well-known publishing house
of D. Appleton and Company, passed
away at his home in Riverdale on
the Hudson, October 19, 1899, having
reached the advanced age of
eighty-five years. As one of the
founders of this magazine, who from
the start was in close sympathy with
its aims, kept up an active interest
in its management, and was ever
ready to aid its conductors with advice
and encouragement, it is fitting
that a few memorial words should
be spoken of him in these columns.</p>

<p>The career of Mr. Appleton was
a marked one in many respects. Entering
the book business of his father,
Mr. Daniel Appleton, at an unusually
early age, he soon developed
such an aptitude for affairs that at
twenty-one he went abroad for the
purpose of making the acquaintance
of the leading foreign publishers and
paving the way for closer relations
with them in the importation and
sale of their books in this country.
Three years later, or at the age of
twenty-four, his father made him a
partner in the business, which had
previously been extended so as to
include the publication as well as
the sale of books, and had now so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
increased in volume as to compel
removal to more commodious quarters.
Ten years of growth and
uninterrupted prosperity followed,
when Mr. Daniel Appleton, in 1848,
retired from the now well-established
firm, William H. Appleton,
at the age of thirty-four, becoming
its head, with his brothers John A.
and Daniel Sidney as partners. In
co-operation with these and other
brothers who afterward entered the
business, Mr. Appleton guided the
operations of the firm for a period
of nearly fifty years, successfully
piloting it through several financial
crises and carrying it to a foremost
place among the publishing houses
of America.</p>

<p>Besides the routine of an extensive
publishing business, the history
of the house during this time includes
a number of large undertakings
involving the expenditure of
vast sums of money, and years of
labor by many workers, and attended
with risks that only the most far-seeing
business sagacity could justify.
We may presume that the several
members of the firm shared a
common faith in the success of these
great enterprises, but it is fair to
infer that as the head of the house
William H. Appleton took a leading
part in their origin and execution.
One of these ventures was the publication
of the American Cyclop&aelig;dia,
which in its present revised
form represents an outlay of over a
million dollars and some ten years
of time. Another undertaking, and
the one that we wish more particularly
to speak of here, was the extension
of the business in the line
of popular scientific publications.</p>

<p>Scientific circles in this country
have never realized the debt they
owe to D. Appleton and Company,
and especially to William H. Appleton,
in this regard. It is no exaggeration
to say that the advance
of science in the United States was
hastened by more than a quarter of
a century by the enlightened and
courageous policy which led the firm
to add this class of books to their
lists at the time they did. Everything
apparently was against it&mdash;nothing
in its favor. Our scientific
literature consisted mainly of a few
text-books having only a limited
sale. Science itself was an affair of
laboratories and bug collectors, the
one to be shunned and the other
commiserated. The few utterances
of scientific men having a bearing
on the great questions of the right
interpretation of Nature, man's relations
to his fellows and to the
world at large, social betterment,
etc., that here and there arrested
public attention were received with
contemptuous sneers or scouted as
the rankest infidelity. Few who are
not past middle life will find it possible
now to realize that this was
the general attitude toward science
forty years ago, but we have only to
refer the reader to the writings of
the time for abundant confirmation
of our statements.</p>

<p>It was such conditions as these
that the firm was called upon to face
when considering the question of
entering this new field of publication.
All ordinary business instincts
were against it. Scarcely a publisher
either here or abroad would
even listen to the proposal to risk
his capital in such an enterprise.
Nevertheless, Mr. Appleton, lending
an appreciative ear to the arguments
of the former editor of this
journal and displaying his usual
foresight, finally decided in favor
of the project, which afterward resulted
in the introduction of the
works of Spencer, Darwin, Huxley,
Tyndall, Bain, Romanes, and other
distinguished writers to American
readers. A further step in the same
direction, taken later, was the publication
of the International Scientific
Series, now numbering some
eighty volumes. The scheme as
originated and shaped by Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Youmans was heartily seconded by
Mr. Appleton, as was also the plan
of the Popular Science Monthly.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the arrangements
for the issue of all these
foreign books, and one which redounds
in no small degree to the
credit of the firm, was the voluntary
agreement, in the absence of an international
copyright law, to pay
their authors the usual royalties,
making no distinction between them
and authors at home. Mr. Appleton
had been a lifelong advocate of
international copyright, founding
his contention on the simple justice
of recognizing the property rights
of the author, no matter where he
lived. Although to adopt such a
course was to expose themselves to
the possibility of heavy loss through
the issue of reprints by irresponsible
parties, a thing which actually
happened in the case of a good many
of the volumes, the principle was
faithfully adhered to, thus anticipating
by many years the central
provision of our present law.</p>

<p>The storm of denunciation raised
abroad by the appearance of the
earlier installments of these writings
might well have deterred the
boldest from repeating the experiment
of giving them currency in
America. But in spite of solemn
warnings that dire consequences
would be visited on the publisher
who ventured to issue them here,
the books continued to appear, while
the predicted evils never came to
pass.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from the
foregoing, however, that Mr. Appleton
was either unmindful or
wanting in respect for the opposition
which his course aroused.
Much of this had its origin in the
religious convictions of the community,
not a little of the criticism, be
it said, emanating directly from the
Church or its leading representatives.
But, being a strong churchman
himself, actively furthering the
work of the Church with his private
means and personal co-operation,
in full sympathy with its purposes,
and rejoicing in its beneficent
influence, he was the last one who
would wantonly outrage the sacred
beliefs of his fellow-men. Yet,
gifted with a large-mindedness that
is at least unusual in the walks of
business, he was enabled to see that
the onward march of natural knowledge
which had so often before excited
alarm among men of narrow
views could have nothing in it that
was inconsistent with a truly religious
life; while, on the other hand,
to promote its advance and diffusion
was to contribute by so much
to the highest human welfare.</p>

<p>The wisdom of Mr. Appleton's
course has been fully justified by the
event. As we look over the last half
of the century, which has been so
fruitful in discovery and has witnessed
the development of so many
agencies for the amelioration of human
ills and so manifold an increase
in man's power for right living, we
can see at the various stages of
this evolution how large a part the
broadening of thought fostered by
these authors and the new aims and
methods in inquiry suggested by
them have contributed to the advance.
It could not, in short, have
been made so rapidly or effectively
without the stimulus they gave. For
what has been done in this line in
this country we think&mdash;when we
reflect that it was he who had the
courage to bring the works of those
thinkers here, and who made them
accessible to students and the reading
public, who constituted the
agency through which the new
thoughts and aims were spread&mdash;a
very important part in the achievement
may fairly be ascribed to Mr.
William H. Appleton.</p>

<h2>Scientific Literature.</h2>

<p>Owing to the increasing demands upon our space, authors and publishers
are notified that hereafter the department of Scientific Literature,
with the exception of Publications Received, will be discontinued.</p>


<h3>SPECIAL BOOKS.</h3>

<p>The busy pen of Mr. <i>John Fiske</i> has produced another book marked
by the qualities which the public has learned to associate with all his work&mdash;lucidity
of expression, felicity of illustration, a large command of the
conventional elements of literary composition, and a philosophy which,
while very free and lightsome in its steps and paces, always has the luck
to fetch up within easy hailing distance of a moderate orthodoxy. Mr.
Fiske undertakes to conduct us on an excursion <i>Through Nature to God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
somewhat as Cook, of international fame, might undertake to see us
safe from New York to the Holy Land. Of the two, we think Cook
makes the surer thing of it; yet no one can deny that Mr. Fiske has
done his best to trace the itinerary and encourage his excursionists to
believe that they will "get there."</p>

<p>We may as well candidly confess that we have not much faith in the
method followed in the work before us. The intention is to show that
an analysis of Nature and of Nature's ways yields God; in other words,
that we have only to carry out the processes of thought which an examination
of the external world and of human history sets in motion in
order to find God at the end of the argument. Thus, by searching, contrary
to what Scripture has generally been held to imply, we find out
both that God is and to some extent what he is. We prefer the older
view. The world's greatest Teacher said simply, "God is a spirit." He
did not say that this was a conclusion to which many lines of argument
led. He did not hint at any kind of argument, but assumed the affirmation
of God by the human consciousness. We venture to say that if
Mr. Fiske's method were successful and we could argue ourselves into
a belief in God, the result would be disastrous; for the God of argument,
or even of analogy, is not the God of the human soul or conscience.
We should have one conclusion more of science, but we should lose that
for which no conclusion of science could make amends&mdash;our sense of the
infinite and the possibility of faith.</p>

<p>Mr. Fiske discusses, in the early chapters of his book, The Mystery of
Evil. He takes the familiar ground that evil is the necessary correlative,
and in a manner the necessary condition, of good. We are placed in a
universe that abounds in evil in order that by conquering it we may raise
ourselves to a moral level otherwise impossible. On one page the author
goes so far as to say that God, and not the devil, "is the creator of evil,"
but elsewhere he relaxes his boldness and speaks of evil being "permitted."
One feels like asking, If good and evil are equally made by
God, then which is which? When we speak of electricity as positive and
negative we do not ascribe any superiority to one over the other. Nor
do we say that centrifugal is a more commendable form of force than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
centripetal, or <i>vice versa</i>. "For strong and resolute men and women,"
we are told, "an Eden would be but a fool's paradise." This is not complimentary
to our first parents in their primitive condition of innocence,
and it puts the curse pronounced upon them in a somewhat equivocal
light. There is also quite a rehabilitation of the "serpent," who, it
seems, knew quite well what he was talking about and gave excellent
advice. We wonder whether Mr. Fiske is really of opinion that it helps
us to solve any of the practical problems of life to be told that without
evil there could not be good. Men have known for centuries that it is
good to fight evil, though what evil is essentially they have often been in
doubt. Upon the latter point Mr. Fiske does not in the least attempt
to enlighten us; and yet it should be rather a more hopeful enterprise
to attempt to show us what is specifically evil and ought therefore to
be resisted, than to vindicate evil in general as the indispensable condition
of good, and something, therefore, which God was justified in
making.</p>

<p>The second division of the book deals with The Cosmic Roots of Love
and Self-Sacrifice. We can not see that these roots are traced further
back than the mother's affection for her offspring. Mother's love is
doubtless an old story in the world by now, and perhaps as good a story
as earth has to tell; but it seems to us that the "cosmic" character of it
is not very apparent. We may believe that it was destined to come in
the fullness of time, but this can be said equally of all that exists. "I
think it can be shown," says Mr. Fiske, "that the principles of morality
have their roots in the deepest foundations of the universe; that the
cosmic process is ethical in the profoundest sense; that, in that far-off
morning of the world when the stars sang together and the sons of God
shouted for joy, the beauty of self-sacrifice and disinterested love formed
the chief burden of the mighty theme." All we can say in regard to this
is that Mr. Fiske has <i>not</i> shown it. He has shown just what we all knew
before&mdash;that love exists in the world, that it antagonizes selfishness, and
that human beings are endowed with a moral and religious sense&mdash;but
he has not made it plain that the meaning of the universe is to be found
in these (as we regard them) higher developments. He has himself acknowledged
that, on a broad view of the world-wide struggle for life,
there are no moral elements to be seen.</p>

<p>Religion, as we hold, is its own justification. There is more of religion
in one verse of the Psalms than in all the Theodicies that ever
were written. "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my
soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God."
Here is the whole essence of the matter&mdash;the affirmation of the human
heart that there is something or some one beyond and above the mesh of
circumstance and fact in which our lives are involved; something or some
one who authenticates all that is good, and everlastingly condemns what
is evil; something or some one to which or to whom the soul gravitates
as to nothing else in the universe. When this affirmation is strong, religious
life is strong; when it is weak, religious life is weak; should it
cease entirely, then religion is dead. The book Mr. Fiske has given us
is interesting from first to last&mdash;all his books are interesting&mdash;but it
does not increase our knowledge, nor does it add to our knowledge faith.</p>

<h2>GENERAL NOTICES.</h2>


<p>The author of <i>Extemporaneous Oratory
for Professional and Amateur
Speakers</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is himself one of the most
effective orators, especially in debate, of
the time. He has embodied in this book
the results of ripened thought and successful
experience gained in a field in
which he is a master, for the instruction
and help of those who would follow
what he regards as the greatest of
all arts, including the elements of all&mdash;music
in the intonations of the voice,
and painting and sculpture in the life,
attitudes, and expression of the speaker.
It is an art, too, which has wielded a
more general and important influence
than any other, which is almost universal
in its appeals, and which any
one may at any time find useful, when
it will be of great advantage to him to
possess the ability "to speak distinctly
to the purpose, gracefully, with genuine
fire." Extemporaneous oratory concerns
the delivery, in form and language
suggested by the occasion, "of
ideas previously conceived and adopted
with more or less fullness and precision,
together with such thoughts and feelings
as may arise and obtain utterance."
It has many advantages over
other methods of oratory, all tending
to give the speaker greater power over
his audience, and particularly in the
fact that the extemporizer is at all
times ready to expound, defend, illustrate,
and enforce his opinions. The extemporaneous
speaker must have a full
and fluent command of language, and
a full store of facts which he may at
any time have to bring to bear upon
the subject of his address and in the
vindication of his opinions. The first
place of importance is given to facts of
natural science, which are of increasing
utility. "To the educated and uneducated
alike, natural science is now
the most interesting of themes." Next
come the facts of history and biography,
those of the special branches
bearing on the speaker's theme and purpose,
and the great general conceptions
included in the thoughts of the learned;
and he must have settled opinions. At
the basis of Dr. Buckley's treatment of
this art and of his advice to those who
would perfect themselves in it is the
principle that extemporization is evolution
after involution. This advice, in
which the various phases of the subject
are commented upon under a great variety
of aspects, concerns the general
preparation for the address, the acquisition
of effective command of language,
the exercise and training of the voice,
the intellectual and physical elements
that enter into oratory, its accessories,
and the factor of the audience&mdash;all
plainly and practically presented, with
a facility of style that makes the reading
of the book a pleasure.</p>

<p>Readers of the Popular Science
Monthly have already had an opportunity
of perusing some of the narrative
and observations which Professor <i>Heilprin</i>
has embodied in his <i>Alaska and
the Klondike</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In it he has attempted
to portray that remarkable region in its
true aspects. Professor Heilprin is well
able to do so, for he is a keen observer
and looks with a scientific eye, and his
literary style is free and graphic. He
made a summer journey to the region
last year (1898), between the end of
July and the middle of October, with
the object of being "able to determine
between fact and fancy, and to obtain
a personal knowledge of the region and
its varied conditions." What he saw
and heard is here presented. While by
no means pretending to that degree of
accuracy and of proper insight which
can only come with more protracted
and intimate knowledge, the author believes
that he has given a careful and
unprejudiced account. Persons whose
ideas of the regions about Dawson are
associated with visions of arctic severity
and sterility may be a little surprised
at reading of one's looking from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the heights about the town northwestward
"over a most lovely stretch of
river, with hillsides closely besetting it,
and with a vegetation of most striking
brilliancy and vigor," and of the eye
turned southward, losing, in consequence
of the different configuration of
the ground, "all but the beautiful verdant
slopes which still mark out the valley";
of the beholder being able for hours
at a time to sit watching the beauty of
the landscape; and of the difficulty of
recommending to one endowed with a
proper appreciation for the works of
quiet Nature "a more enjoyable exercise
than to take in a bit of this wonderful
land of the North, and with it
a mellow sunshine that is not to be
found elsewhere." These pretty landscape
pictures of the arctic summer are
followed by accounts of society at the
Klondike as the author found it, of the
trail, steamboat travel, and the routes
to the region; a description of the
placers, their occurrence, and the methods
of mining; observations on the
physical history and geology of the gold
fields; and a summary of the laws regulating
mining. In the summary of his
geological discussion the author expresses
the opinion that it seems probable
that "the Klondike gold region is
merely a fractional part of a discontinuously
continuous auriferous tract that
extends in a westerly course into the
heart of Alaska, and southward into
British Columbia."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bullen's Idylls of the Sea</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> comprises
three groups of essays, each group
being marked by distinct characteristics.
The sketches in the first group, the
designation of which gives the name to
the book, answer approximately well to
Mr. Strachey's estimation of the whole
as "some of the most vivid things ever
written about the sea," such as only a
man who really knows the sea in all its
humors, and "has heard all those multitudinous
voices that echo along the
waste spaces of the deep," could write.
There is something weird about them,
and they have the air of mystery and
superstitious awe with which, according
to tradition, the sailor regards the imperfectly
understood features of the sea.
They are short stories of curious or
striking incidents of sea life. The essays
of the second group are real natural-history
sketches&mdash;accounts of some oceanic
birds, the kraken, sharks, the devilfish,
etc., by a man who is well and scientifically
acquainted with them. The third
group includes longer sketches of sea-farers'
life, rather more actual ones than
those of the first group, and papers
having a critical bearing on the present
conditions of British seamanship.</p>

<p>The constant advance in the knowledge
of dietetics makes it desirable that
its results should be put in an accessible
form, and this is particularly the case in
regard to food for those in ill health, to
whom it may be the means of restoring
the normal condition. In her book on
<i>Diet in Illness and Convalescence</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the
author has endeavored to present the
substance of Diet for the Sick, now out
of print, together with recent thought
on the subject, especially in the treatment
of typhoid and malarial fevers,
which we owe in such variety to the
present war. An outline is given for
suitable food in the more common forms
of disease, suggestions for serving meals
tastefully to an invalid, and numerous
recipes for beverages, soups, dishes of
meats, vegetables, and desserts. Some of
these are taken from English and French
treatises; others are contributions of
American cooks, and include many novel
and excellent ideas. From the preparation
of koumiss and May wine to the
manipulation of Dixie biscuit there is
no want of explicitness, and one is
tempted to covet the state of convalescence
in which he could fare upon such
attractive compounds as rose, violet, or
amethyst jelly. A word of caution is
inserted now and then. We are told "a
fritter of any kind should never be mentioned
in an invalid's book." Macaroni
croquettes and souffl&eacute; of shad roe are,
however, admissible. The beginning of
the volume is devoted by the author to
a brief consideration of the constituents
of food and processes of digestion, with
directions for the use of the pancreatic
ferments. There are unfortunately many
disputed points concerning a fit dietary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
in illness; not only idiosyncrasies of constitution
but incomplete knowledge of
physiological chemistry still render the
problem difficult. New foods are constantly
introduced which subsequent experiment
proves to be harmful. The last
dictum, we believe, in regard to saccharin
is that it is not wholly innocuous,
so that it might be as well for the diabetic
patient to learn to do without
sweets in the beginning, while as for
the digestive ferments, they are at the
least hazardous concoctions. We can
not be too wary of artificial substitutes
and laboratory products which claim the
virtues of organic material or living protoplasm.</p>

<p>The reason for the being of <i>John
Munro's The Story of the British Race</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
is briefly indicated in the preface as to
be found in the fact that the current
ideas on the subject are derived from
the views of historians representing the
doctrines of an earlier and less critical
generation, while the fact is overlooked
that the new science of anthropology,
using careful observations and exact
methods, has put the real nature of the
British people in a light in which it was
never seen so clearly before. The result
is that the old ideas on the subject have
been greatly modified. Mr. Munro believes
that his little book is the first
attempt to bring these important results
and views of modern anthropologists before
the general public in familiar language,
whereby the oversights of historians
and teachers may be redeemed.
An important error to be controverted,
in the author's view, lies in the fine-drawn
distinctions and sharply defined
demarcations that have been made between
Celts and Saxons. It is inferred
from anthropology that the population
of the British Isles is a mixture of all
the races of western Europe, in which
the Teutonic and Mediterranean elements&mdash;"the
aborigines of Europe"&mdash;predominate,
while "the intrusive Celtic
race from Asia," still represented by the
Bretons, passed into the British Isles in
comparatively small numbers. Scotland
is perhaps more Teutonic and less Mediterranean
than England, Wales, or Ireland.
Wales is the least Teutonic and
the most Mediterranean, if not Celtic,
of the three. England has more of the
Dutch and Low Country elements than
of the Scandinavian, with apparently
not far short of an equal share of the
Mediterranean and Teutonic elements.
Ireland is perhaps as Teutonic as England,
though the better fusion of the
elements may disguise the fact. The
author thinks that the first chapters of
English history will have to be written
over again by the light of anthropology.</p>

<p>The <i>Eighteenth Annual Report of the
United States Geological Survey</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> mentions,
as an important change in the
field work that made necessary by the
legislation providing for the establishment
of levels and permanent monuments
and bench marks, of which 10,840
miles of levels were run and 1,820 bench
marks were established. The topographic
surveys to date covered an aggregate
area of 759,525 square miles, of which
240,000 square miles were on a scale of
four miles to the inch. The topographic
work has progressed very satisfactorily
under the present organization of the
survey, including, in the year covered by
the report, surveys in the Indian Territory
and of the northern part of the
boundary line between Idaho and Montana&mdash;the
first work of the kind assigned
to the Geological Survey&mdash;and
the beginning of the survey of the forest
reserves. The work on the educational
series of rocks has been completed. It
includes two hundred and fifty larger
and smaller sets, which will be distributed
to institutions where geology is
taught. In his general report the director
mentions the work of more than
thirty geological parties in all parts of
the United States, of six paleontological
parties, hydrographic and topographic
surveys by States, and the work of the
division of mineral resources, the full account
of which will constitute Part V of
the report. The theoretic and other
papers in Part II relate to the Triassic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Formation of Connecticut (W. M. Davis),
Geology of the Edwards Plateau,
etc., Texas (R. T. Hill and J. W.
Vaughan), North American Tertiary
Horizons (W. H. Dall), Glaciers of Mount
Rainier (I. C. Russell) and Rocks of
Mount Rainier (G. O. Smith), The
Franklin White Limestone of New Jersey
(J. E. Wolfe and A. H. Brooks), the
Geology of San Clemente Island (W. S.
T. Smith), Geology of the Cape Cod District
(N. H. Shaler), and Recent Earth
Movement in the Great Lakes Region
(G. K. Gilbert). Part III contains papers
on the gold districts of Alaska, by
G. F. Becker, J. E. Spurr, and H. B.
Goodrich; Coal Fields of Puget Sound (B.
Willis), the Judith Mountains of Montana
(W. H. Weed and L. V. Pirsson),
Certain Mining Districts in Idaho (W.
Lindgren and F. H. Knowlton), and the
Mining Districts of the Telluride Quadrangle,
Colorado (C. W. Purington). The
four papers in Part IV are a Report of
Progress of Stream Measurements during
1896, by A. P. Davis; the Water Resources
of Indiana and Ohio, by Frank
Leverett; New Developments in Well-boring
in South Dakota, by N. H. Darton;

<p>The purpose of <i>Belle S. Cragin's Our
Insect Friends and Foes</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> is illustrated
from a passage in the author's own life,
cited in the preface: "In my younger
days, when Nature study was unknown
in schools and my problems had to be
solved by my own investigations or remain
unsolved, I used to long for somebody
to write a book that would tell me
the things I wished to know, or show me
how to find them out for myself; and
that is what I have tried to do for you."
The beginning of the book is a chapter
on the collection, preservation, and care
of insects for specimens, giving explicit
directions for collecting them perfect, for
putting them to death, for mounting and
placing them in the cabinet, and for protecting
them against vermin, dust, and
mold, with descriptions of the instruments,
cases, etc., that are used. In the
descriptions of insects no attempt is
made to mention any except the commonest
species, and not all of those. The
habitat, in most cases, is included in the
description. As a rule, most of the species
are those found in the States east
of the Rocky Mountains and north of
the Gulf States. Scientific names are attached
to the illustrations and a list
of popular names, with their scientific
equivalents. The descriptions are brief
and well adapted to the purpose indicated
in the quotation with which our
notice begins.</p>

<p>In presenting a revision of their
<i>Plane and Solid Geometry</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Messrs.
<i>Beman</i> and <i>Smith</i> express their belief
as being, that amid all the schemes for
breaking away from the formal proofs
of Euclid and Legendre and leading the
student to independent discovery, the
best results are secured by setting forth
a minimum of formal proofs as models,
and a maximum of unsolved or unproved
propositions as exercises. They
likewise share in the belief that such
of the notions of modern geometry as
materially simplify the ancient should
find place in our elementary text-books.
Accordingly, they have introduced various
ideas, such as those of one-to-one
correspondence, anti-parallels, negative
magnitudes, general figures, prismatic
space, similarity of point systems, etc.,
which are of real use in the early study
of the science. In general, whatever is
found to be usable in elementary work
has been inserted where it will prove
of most value.</p>

<p>The plan of the investigation undertaken
by Mr. <i>Walter Smith</i> in his <i>Methods
of Knowledge</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> is, first, to give a
definition of knowledge. The methods
are then considered by which men have
thought it possible to attain knowledge
of the self on the one hand, and the
not-self on the other. The common
view of philosophers and men of science
that truth is given in general concepts,
or universals, or categories, is taken up,
and the special form of the doctrine
given in empiricism is considered and
found to be a doctrine wanting in all
its forms. Yet it is pointed out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the concept has its uses in the mental
economy. The method is then expounded
of knowing the not-self as being
gained by sympathetic imitation. It is
then determined wherein self-knowledge
consists, and the bearing of this theory
on the philosophical problem and on
certain practical questions is indicated.</p>

<p>In <i>The Philosophy of Memory and
Other Essays</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Dr. <i>D. T. Smith</i> develops
a theory of mental action, the basis of
which is the setting up in the cells of
the gray matter of the brain, and possibly
of the spinal cord, of orderly
grouping of waves or vibrations among
certain atoms or molecules by whatever
may affect any of the senses; that
these undulations are realized first as
sensations, and then group themselves
so as to form perceptions, ideas, emotions,
etc. They rise in succession into
the scope of consciousness. After a time
the effect of these vibrations in consciousness
is weakened, without perhaps
utterly passing away, and retains
the possibility of being re-enforced by
kindred vibrations in harmony with it.
This is memory.</p>

<p>In <i>The Psychology of Reasoning</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
M. <i>Alfred Binet</i> makes reasoning a
process of the formation of mental images.
He finds no decided difference
between perception&mdash;the cognizance of
sensations and assignment of them to
their source&mdash;and logical reasoning.
"The two operations are both reasonings,
transitions from the known to the
unknown"; "the two extremes of a
long series of phenomena." A premise
is "a judgment, an association of images,"
and a conclusion that follows
from the premises is "an association of
images produced by other associations."
The theory of three images&mdash;the two
premises and the conclusion&mdash;"is applicable
to reasonings of every kind, and
therefore constitutes a general theory
of reasoning.... If it be recollected
that images are fragments, residues of
former sensations; that they spring
from the place where former sensations
have been received, in the sensory
centers of the cerebral surface layers,
it will be understood that the purpose
of these images in grouping themselves
in reasonings, according to the laws of
their affinity, is to replace the absent
sensations. Such is therefore the function
of reasoning; it enlarges the sphere
of our sensibility, and extends it to all
objects which our senses can not know
directly. Thus understood, reasoning is
a <i>supplementary sense</i>, which has the
advantage of being free from those
strict conditions of time and space&mdash;the
two enemies of human knowledge."
In memory, "the suggested image is
projected and localized in the panorama
of the past, of which it appears to be a
fragment." Imagination is "a faculty
of creating assemblages of images which
do not correspond to any external reality."</p>

<p>The idea of preparing <i>Who's Who in
America</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> was suggested by the success
of the English book, Who's Who? now
in its fifty-second year, and the work
has been prepared on similar lines. Its
purpose is to supply information concerning
living American men and
women who have achieved distinction,
who hold recognized public positions,
and who have contributed so as to have
it talked about to the growth, development,
knowledge, and civilization of the
country. Eight thousand six hundred
and two such persons are represented
in this book, including, <i>ex-officio</i>, all
members of the Fifty-sixth Congress,
Governors of States and Territories now
in office, United States, State, and territorial
judges of courts of high jurisdiction,
persons of other prominent official
classification, national academicians,
members of the National Academy of
Sciences, heads of the larger universities
and colleges, and a few others chosen on
similar arbitrary lines. Special effort
has been made to include all living
American authors of books of more than
ephemeral value. The data for the book
have been obtained from first hands,
except in a very few cases, where the
modesty of the subjects made it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
to supply the material from other
sources, when the articles were submitted
to the subjects for revision.</p>

<p>In <i>The Dawn of Reason</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Dr. <i>Weir</i>
has provided a most interesting book
for the unscientific reader as well as for
the comparative psychologist. He traces
the gradual unfolding of conscious mind
in animal life from the actinophryans
which discriminates between the grains
of starch and sand, and the Stentor
which changes its position to catch a
ripened spore, to the higher forms that
decorate their homes, exhibit parental
affection, exercise mathematical faculty,
and extricate themselves from unforeseen
dangers. As the field of observation
of the senses of touch, taste, and
smell has been so thoroughly worked
by Lubbock and other naturalists, special
attention is paid by the author to
the senses of sight and hearing, in regard
to which he furnishes new and valuable
data. In addition to these he claims to
establish the fact that tinctumutations
and "homing" are auxiliary senses&mdash;not
instincts. He located the center of color
changing in the frog exactly below the
optic, and by artificial stimulation produced
the alteration in tint, and by excision,
or treatment with atropine, destroyed
the chromatophoric function.
By experimentation upon snails he found
the center of the sense of locality at the
base of the cephalic ganglion, and, removing
it, rendered them unable to return
to their homes. Many anecdotes
are given showing that the lower orders
of animal life exercise conscious determination,
and that among those with
more complex nervous systems there is
a mind akin to that of man. Not only
do animals remember friends, strangers,
and events, but they love, hate, and
fear. They evince &aelig;sthetic feeling also
when the spider ornaments its web with
logwood flakes, the dog howls in harmonic
accord with the church bell, and
salamanders assemble at the sound of a
piccolo. Still higher psychical attributes
are those of animals that show parental
affection or ability to count, like the
mason wasp, which provides invariably
five spiders for the male larva and eight
for the female; or the harvester ants
that plant their grain, weed and winnow
it. Examples are cited of the capacity
of the elephant to form abstract
ideas and of the dog to indulge in brown
studies. The author scouts at the theory
that "specialized instinct," or "intelligent
accident," prompts actions in
animals which in man would be ascribed
to reason. "Instinct," he writes, "is
the bugbear of psychologists," and thereupon
he differentiates sharply the two
sadly confused functions.</p>

<p>In the thesis entitled <i>A Step Forward</i>,
<i>F. Theodor Kruger</i> proposes, as a
measure of possible social reform, placing
the medical and legal professions
wholly under the direct control of the
civil authorities, to be exercised through
duly constituted boards or departments
of the several communities.</p>

<p>In his study of <i>Centralized Administration
of Liquor Laws in the American
Commonwealths</i> (Columbia University
Studies in History, Economics, and Public
Law) <i>Clement M. L. Sites</i> finds that
widely variant policies are followed by
the several States in the regulation of
the liquor traffic, all based upon the
broad powers of taxation and police.
While we hear much of characteristic
plans of regulation, little is said about
characteristic systems of administration.
This is because the liquor laws are
administered incoherently. There is no
consensus, even within the Commonwealth,
in standards of administration.
Each community practically determines
for itself how the law shall be enforced,
and we have all degrees of enforcement,
from rigid severity to none. The various
plans of regulation are classified by
the author according to the dominant
aspect in which they regard the liquor
traffic. It has been treated as an open
traffic, subject simply to taxation and
reasonable safeguards; as a necessary
but dangerous business, to be limited
to approved persons and places and surrounded
by special safeguards; as a
criminal enterprise, to be suppressed,
like highway robbery; and as a subject
of legal monopoly. It is the purpose of
Mr. Sites's essay to follow the developments
of centralized administration that
have taken place in recent years in each
of these spheres, and in that of the institution
and maintenance of judicial
proceedings. The phases of current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
development that seem to merit special
note are the substitution of the liquor-tax
system for the license system, the
extension and elaboration of local option,
the contingent central control of
city police administration, and the recognition
of the general province of administration.
The author's study shows
that these developments accord in general
with the laws of evolution, each
representing some special aspect of the
differentiation. In considering the "dispensary"
plan, illustrated in South
Carolina, a significant contribution to
current thought is remarked in the approval
it gives to the use of liquors as
a beverage, while their abuse is disapproved
in an equally marked degree, a
distinction being attempted here, with
correspondingly different methods of
treatment between those who can be
trusted with liquors and those who
can not.</p>

<p><i>The Report of the United States Commissioner
of Fish and Fisheries</i> for the
year ending June 30, 1898, represents
that the operations of the division of fish
culture were in some respects more important
during that than in any preceding
year. This was owing in part
to the natural growth of the work, and
in part to greater efficiency in dealing
with the various questions and problems
that came up for consideration. The
propagation and distribution of food
fishes exceeded by about forty per cent
the work accomplished in any other
twelve months. The steady increase in
the catch of shad is cited as being conclusive
evidence of the value of artificial
propagation. The constant decline
in the lobster fishery accentuates the necessity
for increased work in that line.
The efforts to acclimatize food fishes in
waters to which they are not indigenous
have been continued. The special papers
published in connection with the report
relate to mackerel investigations, the
alewife fisheries, the oyster beds of Louisiana,
the shad fisheries of the Atlantic
coast, reports of fishes obtained in
sea explorations, a list of publications,
and a report of the exhibit at the Tennessee
Centennial.</p>

<p><i>The Tenth Annual Report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission on the
Statistics of Railways in the United
States</i> covers the year ending June 30,
1897. The year is characterized as having
been for the transportation industry
one "of deferred expectations." While
the years from 1890 to 1893 each closed
with increased gross earnings as compared
with the preceding year, 1893-'94
was disastrous, showing a large decrease;
no recovery took place in 1894-'95,
but an increase took place in 1895-'96.
A downward turn came again in
the year of the present report, with no
revival till the last month of the twelve.
The total increase in mileage for the
year of the report was only 1,651.84
miles, the smallest increase and the
smallest percentage of increase noted in
any year since 1890. "In many States,"
says the report, "railway construction
seems to have been practically abandoned.
Especially is this noticeable in
the more populous districts of the country&mdash;a
result which is not entirely due
to the general commercial depression,
but to the marvelous increase in electric
railways for suburban and short-distance
traffic. The influence of electric
construction upon steam transportation
is noted in certain of the reports of State
railway commissions for the current
year." These are only two of the numerous
interesting facts presented in the
report.</p>

<p><i>Small Accumulators, how Made and
Used</i>, is the first of a series of popular
scientific handbooks for students and
engineers. The particular subject has
been selected for beginning the series
under the suggestion of a large number
of requests for advice which the author,
<i>Percival Marshall</i>, had received in his
capacity as editor of the Model Engineer
and Amateur Electrician. The
work is intended to be an elementary
handbook&mdash;"a practical and trustworthy
guide"&mdash;for amateurs and students.
The theory of the accumulator is explained,
directions are given for making
them, types of small accumulators are
illustrated, the charging and use of accumulators
are explained, and the applications
are shown. Useful receipts
and a glossary of technical terms are
given. (The book is published by Spon
&amp; Chamberlain, New York. Price, 50
cents.)</p>

<p>In his <i>Better World Philosophy&mdash;a
Sociological Synthesis</i> (Chicago: the
Ward Waugh Company), <i>J. Howard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Moore</i> utters a protest against the egoism
or selfishness of our day, and suggests
an ideal scheme. The problem of
life is defined as being the relation of
each individual to the rest of the universe,
and is peculiarized by the existence
of the social problem involving
relations of individuals to each other
different from those sustained to the impersonal
universe. There are in the nature
of living beings the egoistic element,
which impels action in behalf of
self, and the altruistic element, which
prompts or prevents movement out of
consideration to others. At present the
egoistic element predominates, with results
that make a picture far from
bright. In the social ideal the strong
should supplement the weak as they
would like to be supplemented if they
were weak; individuals not unequal but
diverse may mutualize their efforts to
the advantage of all; and each individual
should perform in the social economy
that function for which he is best
fitted, and should receive in return "a
graceful equity in the means for satisfying
his desires."</p>

<p>Among the books announced for
issue soon by Henry Holt &amp; Co. are
<i>The Book of Vertebrate Zo&ouml;logy</i>, by
Prof. <i>J. S. Kingsley</i>, author of The Elements
of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy, published
by the same house, which can be
used as a companion to McMurrich's Invertebrate
Zo&ouml;logy; <i>Elementary Studies
in Chemistry</i>, by Prof. <i>Joseph Torrey</i>,
of Harvard, which, while it is characterized
by the emphasis laid upon quantitative
laboratory work in general
chemistry, will be a comprehensive text-book
on the whole subject; and <i>Moulds,
Mildews, and Mushrooms</i>, a guide to the
systematic study of the fungi and <i>Mycetozoa</i>
and their literature, by Prof.
<i>Lucien Underwood</i>, of Columbia University.</p>

<p>Miss Cornelia E. Horsford, being interested
in the question of the origin of
certain ancient ruins situated on the
Charles River, Mass., and elsewhere in
America, which were discovered by the
late Prof. E. N. Horsford and were believed
by him to be relics of the settlements
formed by the Norsemen in the
tenth century, commissioned Mr. Thorstein
Erlingsson to examine for comparison
certain ancient dwellings in Iceland,
in the summer of 1895. The inquiries
assigned to him related to the method
of construction of the long houses,
square buildings, hillside cots with pavements,
mounds, things and doom rings,
irrigation and drainage, ditches, river
dams, hithes and ship docks, or <i>nauts</i>,
grave-hills, and forts. The results of the
study are given, with illustrations, in a
small book, <i>Ruins of the Saga Times</i>, by
<i>Thorstein Erlingsson</i>. (Published by
David Nutt, London.) Mr. Erlingsson's
report is supplemented by an outline of
already ascertained knowledge regarding
early Scandinavian home building,
derived from previous excavations and
investigations furnished by F. T. Norris
and J&ouml;n Stef&aacute;nsson, and a summary in
French by M. E. D. Grand.</p>

<p><i>The Quarterly Journal of the Anthropological
Institute of Great Britain
and Ireland</i> was issued during the thirty-seven
years from the beginning of
1871 in the form styled demi-octavo.
The small pages of this size entailed
some inconveniences, especially when
ample plates and tables were needed for
illustration. With the double number
(August and November, 1898) a new
series was begun, in the form styled imperial
octavo, with a page considerably
larger than in the old form and corresponding
in size with the important
publications of some of the continental
societies of Europe. This number contains
the proceedings of seven meetings
of the society and important anthropological
articles, some of them on American
subjects. Among them is a criticism,
by Prof. W. Z. Ripley, on Deniker's
Classification of the Races of Europe.</p>

<p>In <i>How to Swim</i> (Putnams, $1) Captain
<i>Davis Dalton</i>, Chief Inspector of
the United States Volunteer Life-Saving
Corps, gives a practical treatise upon
the art of natation, together with instruction
as to the best methods of
saving persons imperiled in the water
and of resuscitating persons apparently
drowned. The treatise covers every
branch of the art, and abounds in cautions
in connection with nearly every
topic, against the mistakes that may
arise from timidity or the carelessness
of over-confidence. The author holds
that swimming is an art to be acquired
and learned like other athletic arts, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
it depends upon natural principles.
The best movements for taking
advantages of the physical laws involved
in it have been studied by competent
men, and a brief and clear presentation
of them is attempted here. First,
we have the lessons for the beginner,
who must, before all things, "have confidence."
The different strokes are described
in detail and illustrated; the different
modes of swimming and the postures,
swimming in clothes, taking off
clothes in the water, diving and swimming
under water, swimming in waves,
and other features are explained; and,
finally, the life-saving directions are
given, and public education in swimming
is insisted upon.</p>

<p><i>The Southern Magazine</i> is a new
monthly, published at Manassas, Va., by
the Southern Publishing Company, of
which we have the third number, that
for August. It has a definite flavor of
the old South, for which we find no
fault with, for there was much about
the old South which ought to be preserved,
and no little that was too precious
to be lost. Among the matters of
special interest in this number are the
Sketch of Sidney Lanier, by Ellen Manderson,
with selections from his writings;
The Last Meeting of the Confederate
Cabinet (held, by a curious coincidence,
at Abbeville, S. C., where secession
was started), by Walter L. Miller;
an account of the University of Virginia,
by John S. Patten, which appears
to be the first of a series on Southern
Educational Institutions; and an article
on South Carolina in Letters, by Colonel
J. P. Thomas.</p>

<p>The fifth yearly number of <i>L'Ann&eacute;e
Psychologique</i> of MM. <i>Alfred Binet</i>, <i>H.
Beaunis</i>, and <i>Th. Ribot</i> is a volume of
902 pages, of which 591 pages are included
in the first part, devoted to Original
Memoirs and General Reviews. The
papers are nineteen in number, on such
subjects as muscular fatigue, the foreshortening
of objects rising from the
horizon, stereognostic perception and
stereoagnosy, suggestibility, applications
of the calculation of probabilities
to psychology, colored audition, mental
labor and nutritive changes, measure of
mental fatigue, sensations of smell, phonographs
and the study of the vowels,
cephalometry, pedology, volume of the
arm and muscular force, chronophotographic
and other apparatus, and muscular
sense; and the authors are MM.
Van Biervliet, of Ghent; Blum, of
N&icirc;mes; Bourdon, of Rennes; Clapar&egrave;de,
of Geneva; Clavi&egrave;re, Delage, Demeny,
Druault, Mlle. Joteyko, MM. Larguier,
Manouvrier, Marage; Marbe, of W&uuml;rzburg;
Obersteiner, of Vienna; Tscherning
and Zwaardemaker, of Utrecht. M.
V. Henri's paper on Muscular Sense
would make a volume by itself. The
second part&mdash;Analyses&mdash;consists of reviews
of psychological publications entered
under ten headings. The Bibliography
contains 2,558 titles, and the
index of authors fills upward of seventeen
double-columned pages. (Paris:
Scheicher Fr&egrave;res.)</p>

<p>Valuable papers on Comparative
Tests of Bituminous Steam Coals, by
John W. Hill; the Artificial Preservation
of Railroad Ties by the Use of
Zinc Chloride, by W. W. Curtis; and
the Theory of Concrete, by G. W. Rafter,
are given in the <i>Proceedings of the
American Society of Civil Engineers</i>
(vol. xxv, No. 4, April, 1899), together
with discussions respecting street grades
and cross-sections in asphalt and cement
and to loads and maximum stress on
members of a bridge truss; also biographical
sketches of D. L. Barnes and
W. R. Michie.</p>

<p>A valuable addition to D. Appleton
and Company's International Education
Series, and a sprightly book in
itself withal, is <i>Montaigne on the Education
of Children</i>, a volume of selections
bearing on the subject from the
writings of the quaint old Frenchman,
translated and annotated by L. E. Rector.
The significance of Montaigne, as
the editor of the series observes in his
preface to the volume, lies chiefly in his
protest against pedantry, and the translator
finds Montaigne's modernity shown
in his attempt to degrade men learning
from the first place, and to lay the
emphasis on fitness for practical life,
ability to use one's judgment, and morality
and virtue. While Montaigne
had limitations and defects in his educational
views, such as are pointed out
by Dr. Harris, he still appears to have
been far in advance of his own time,
and in some respects of the present time
as well. The solution of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
problem, success in dealing with one's
self and his fellows, was his ideal. The
translator shows how Locke and Rousseau,
and, of course, all educational
writers who have built upon these, drew
from him. The subjects of the selections
given here are the Education of
Children, Pedantry, the Affection of Fathers,
Liars, Physiognomy, Anger, the
Art of Conversation, Idleness, Experience,
and History.</p>

<p>An essay on <i>The Object of the Labor
Movement</i>, by <i>Johann Jacoby</i>, translated
by Florence Kelley, and published
by the International Publishing Company,
advocates co-operation, demands
that the employer recognize the laborer
whom he employs as a being fully his
own equal and treat him accordingly,
and claims of the State an especial consideration
of the working class as an act
of reparative justice.</p>

<p>The <i>Transactions of the First and
Second Regular Meetings of the Wyoming
State Medical Society</i>, May 13
and November 1, 1898, shows that that
body is vigorous and active, and that
the doctors of Wyoming are interested
in maintaining the dignity and reputation
of their profession. It is represented
that fully fifty per cent of the
regular physicians of the State have already
been enrolled as members of the
society.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Frederick H. Gelman's Elements
of Blowpipe Analysis</i> (New York: The
Macmillan Company; 60 cents) is intended
to serve the twofold purpose of
giving the student a general outline of
the analysis and of introducing him to
the methods of determinative mineralogy.
Every effort has been made to
simplify the account. The first chapter
is devoted to Apparatus and Details, and
the second to the General Outline of
Blowpipe Analysis. Then the general
reactions for the detection of the metallic
elements in simple compounds are
described, the behavior of some of the
principal ores before the blowpipe, and
comparative tables.</p>

<h2>Fragments of Science.</h2>


<p><b>The Dread of the Jew.</b><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;The
Dreyfus affair and the furious passions
that it has awakened have their ultimate
foundation in dread and hatred of
the Jews. There is a Jewish question,
more or less acute, in every continental
country, and we are told by pessimists
that before long we shall have an anti-Jewish
movement in the East End of
London. These facts naturally suggest
an inquiry into the causes of the dread
and hate which the Jews inspire, and
the asking once again whether there are
any good grounds for regarding the Hebrew
race as a menace to the Christian
world. The main fact about the Jews
on the Continent which emerges from a
study of the present situation is that
for some reason or other they inspire
terror. That this terror is as absurd
and as unreasonable as is the terror
caused respectively by Jesuits and Freemasons,
we ourselves do not doubt for
a moment, but that does not alter the
fact that the sense of terror exists. It
is hardly too much to say that the majority
of people on the Continent honestly
believe that unless the Jews are
in some way or other curbed, controlled,
and kept down, something very dreadful
will happen. In Russia the vast Slavonic
population and its leaders believe
that unless the Jews are impounded in
the Polish Pale they will swamp the
true Russian, and utterly ruin and destroy
the Russian nationality and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Russian ideal. In Austria it is believed
that if the Jews are allowed to go on
as they are going on they will get everything
into their hands&mdash;the land of the
peasants, the sources of public information
and the press, and the nerves by
which trade and commerce are moved.
In Germany it is much the same story,
and there the Jews are believed, unless
stopped in time, to be about to monopolize
the universities. In France it is
thought that the Jews, if not put down
with the strong hand, will capture the
whole administration, as well as "strangle
commerce by their octopus grip."
The Jews are called a "parasitic race,"
whatever that may mean. It is said
that the Jew never becomes an agriculturist,
that he is a usurer and a
bloodsucker, that he is a gross materialist,
and that he has no ideals beyond
the precious metals; and that they habitually
act together to further their
own racial interests and to injure those
communities which have been foolish
enough to trust them. To take the
charge of want of patriotism first. How
is it substantiated? We can not say
that we have ever seen any real evidence
of want of patriotism in the Jews. Look
at the case of France at present. There
is something extremely pathetic in the
way in which the French Jews cling to
their nationality in spite of all the
hatred they inspire. The truth is, the
Jew is a sort of expert in patriotism.
Did not the Maccabees teach the world
one of its first lessons in patriotism?
Depend upon it, if the Jew is only allowed
to be a patriot he will not fail
here. The charge, indeed, is like that
so often made in Russia against the
Jews. They are accused of not tilling
the soil, their accusers ignoring the fact
that no Jew is allowed to buy, or to
lease, or to occupy land, and is, in fact,
excluded by law from acting as a farmer.
Take next the charge of "aloofness."
Probably this charge is well founded,
but what can be expected of a people
so newly freed from the Ghetto? If you
treat a race for centuries as lepers, and
visit its members with dire penalties, if
they do not keep "aloof" they are likely
to remain for some time disinclined
to free intercourse. The third charge is,
in reality, that the Jews of the world,
having obtained control of cosmopolitan
finance, act together in the interests of
their race, and inflict grievous injuries
upon the nations. But what proof is
there of this? Curiously enough, Mr.
Arnold White&mdash;though in other ways
he seems to encourage this charge&mdash;accuses
the great Jewish financiers of not
doing this very thing. He tells us that
after the Russians had driven the Jews
into the Pale they wanted to raise a
loan. One would have expected the
great Jewish loanmongers to have absolutely
refused to help the enemy of
the race. Instead they basely, as we
think, found Russia the money she
wanted. But though this was a base
act, it certainly is not consistent with
the charge that the Jews control the
international money market for tribal
ends. We believe, in fact, that this
whole charge is a pure delusion. The
great financiers, whether Jew or Gentile,
look for a profit, and not to deep
and mysterious racial aspirations. The
charge that the Jews are steeped in materialism,
and so are a demoralizing element
in the community, is equally unfair
and absurd. Many Jews may be
fond of pomp of a vulgar kind, and may
affect what we confess personally to
finding very disagreeable forms of Asiatic
luxury; but these are externals. In
essentials and as a race the Jews are
no more materialistic than their neighbors.
And can we say that they are
a demoralizing element when it is universally
confessed that the Jews are
among the best fathers, sons, and husbands
in the world?</p>

<p><b>Death of Professor Bunsen.</b>&mdash;With
the death of Robert Wilhelm Bunsen,
at Heidelberg, August 16th, the world
loses a student whose name is inseparably
connected with nearly all the chemical
work that has been done in the
last fifty years, for it is safe to say that
hardly a discovery has been made or
experiment performed to the success of
which some process, property, or instrument
discovered, invented, or suggested
by Bunsen, and usually named after
him, has not contributed. A sketch of
this illustrious chemist, with a portrait,
and an enumeration of his principal
works, each of which might be characterized
as a milestone in the advance of
the science, was published in the Popular
Science Monthly for August, 1881
(vol. xix, page 550). One of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
events in his life since that sketch
was published was his election, in 1883,
as one of the eight foreign associates of
the French Academy of Sciences&mdash;the
highest honor that that institution is
competent to confer. Besides Bunsen's
personal interest in the work and success
of his students, one of his most
salient traits, as described by a careful
and appreciative biographer in the New
York Evening Post, was his absentmindedness
concerning what he had himself
accomplished. He was afflicted with
an "incipient aphasia," which made it
impossible for him to talk about them.
"He could not answer verbal questions,
whether oral or written. He could not
have passed a decent examination in his
own discoveries. Let the question come
in the shape of an emergency in a chemical
operation, and a wealth of knowledge
would be poured out, but let it
be put in words and he could not answer
it." He is said to have answered
a student once, who asked him about
some substance, that he knew nothing
about it&mdash;"You will have to look up
the literature." The student looked up
the literature, and found that it consisted
of a single article, and that by
Bunsen! Professor Bunsen prized what
would stimulate him to effort, enjoyed
life, was fond of travel and interested
in everything human, and was a good
novel reader.</p>

<p><b>The Unprofitableness of Strikes.</b>&mdash;The
cost of a large strike is impressively
illustrated in some of the results
of the great colliery dispute of 1898 in
South Wales, as they are set forth in
the British Board of Trade returns and
the reports of the consular service. In
direct financial loss, the company suffered
to the extent of $100,000, and the
men of $300,000 in wages, besides the
demoralization from being so long out
of work. To a certain extent, other districts
gained what the South Wales
mines lost by the diversion of trade to
them, but that simply aggravated the
evil in the mines, for some of this diverted
trade will stay where it went.
It is sometimes said, indeed, that strikes
have only a temporary effect on business,
from which it will recover in time.
This is true, however, as is suggested in
Industries and Iron, only when the locality
affected has a virtual monopoly
of the trade, while in the competition
of the nations instances of that kind are
growing rarer. England especially has
many rivals in these days, eager to take
advantage of every opportunity to profit
by its mistakes or misfortunes, and
which, when they get their hands on a
good thing, are not apt to let go. Notwithstanding
some strikes at home, the
coal trade in the United States derived
benefits from the British strike by sending
to markets which the Welsh mines
should have supplied; Germany sent
coal to Sweden, and Belgium increased
its shipments to the Canary Islands.
Other countries are induced, by conditions
making the usual sources of supply
inconvenient to them, to a more active
development of their own resources,
as Austria-Hungary, Spain, and France
were in the present case. So it is
more than doubtful whether the present
strike paid.</p>

<p><b>The Scientific Spirit.</b>&mdash;The study
of science, especially of an experimental
science, said Prof. R. H. Chittenden in
an informal talk to students of the
Sheffield Scientific School, is peculiarly
adapted for developing the power of independent
thought, and of training one
in drawing logical conclusions from experimental
data. In the laboratory is
afforded an opportunity for making observations,
but if real benefit is to be derived
from the experimental work there
must be a full realization of the necessity
of careful thought in drawing deductions
from the results observed.
Broad generalizations built on a slender
foundation of fact frequently topple to
the ground, and sometimes carry destruction
with them, all because of a
lack of that critical spirit which prompts
a careful and thorough consideration of
all the premises. The man who has acquired
the habit of careful thought, of
reasoning out each step in a process,
of weighing carefully each reaction involved,
of seeking in his own mind the
reason for this or that phenomenon,
who looks at both sides of a question,
and carefully considers all the facts
available, will build much more surely
and firmly than he who by specious
arguments constructs a glittering hypothesis,
only to see it fade away.
Hasty reasoning, insufficient data, obscure
facts, are the bane of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
science. The true scientific spirit prompts
to thorough inquiry; it will have nothing
to do with hasty generalizations
that may glitter but do not convince;
it puts a restraining hand on all immature
conclusions, and demands, above
all else, careful, thorough observation.
It shuns all shams. Good, honest work
is the only passport to the domain of
science.</p>

<p><b>Constitution of the Funafuti
Atoll.</b>&mdash;In the boring of the coral atoll
of Funafuti, Professor David, of the
University of Sydney, reached a depth
of 697 feet, and a subsequent boring was
made down to about 1,000 feet. The core
obtained by the David party was sent to
England and placed in the hands of
Professor Judd for investigation. The
general statement is made respecting it
that the material brought up presents
much the same character throughout,
and so far is regarded as supporting
Darwin's theory. There are no layers
of chalky ooze, such as Murray's hypothesis
might have made possible, and
no trace of volcanic material has been
found. The later boring beyond 700
feet passed through a hard limestone
containing many well-preserved corals.
In a boring of the bed of the lagoon
down to 144 feet, after passing through
101 feet of water, the first 80 feet below
were found to consist of the calcareous
alga Halimeda mixed with shells, and
the remaining 64 feet of the same material
mixed with gravel.</p>

<p><b>Metallic Calcium.</b>&mdash;Metallic calcium,
as prepared by Professor Moissan
from solution in liquid sodium, separates
in hexagonal crystals which have
a specific gravity of 1.85 and melt at
760&deg; <i>in vacuo</i>. On solidifying, the metal
is somewhat brittle, is less malleable
than potassium and sodium, and shows
a crystalline fracture. When free from
nitride it is silver-white in color, and
has a brilliant surface. Heated to redness
in a current of hydrogen, a crystalline
hydride, CaH&#8322;, is formed. When
pure, calcium is not acted upon at ordinary
temperatures by chlorine, though
at 100&deg; C. the action is decided. But
if the metal contains nitride, chlorine
attacks it at the ordinary temperature.
At 300&deg; C. calcium ignites and burns
brilliantly in oxygen. Gently warmed
in air, it burns with brilliant scintillations.
It combines with sulphur, with
incandescence, at 400&deg; C. At a red heat
it unites actively with lampblack, giving
a carbide, CaC&#8322;. It gives some brittle
alloys with magnesium, zinc, and
nickel. The alloy with tin slowly decomposes
water. A crystalline amalgam
is formed with mercury, which
may be distilled in hydrogen at 400&deg;
C., but which forms nitride when heated
in nitrogen. Heated to redness with
potassium or sodium chloride, calcium
sets the metal free. Water acts on calcium
only very slowly, with the evolution
of hydrogen. In liquefied ammonia
at -40&deg; C. calcium ammonia is
formed&mdash;a reddish-brown solid.</p>

<p><b>Prosperity and Enterprise in
Mexico.</b>&mdash;The increasing prosperity of
Mexico is one of the striking features
of current history. In four years the
imports of the country increased from
$30,000,000 in 1894 to upward of $45,000,000
in 1898, the average for five
years having been $40,000,000. The
chief sellers to Mexicans are the United
States, Great Britain, France, and Germany,
and the keenness of the competition
for trade is shown in the fluctuations
in the relative shares of it of the
several countries. Spain has a small
share of trade, which is growing. Industrial
enterprises are being developed
throughout the country with energy,
enterprise, and success. Cotton and
linen factories have been established,
attention is given to the erection of
woolen mills, and a noticeable activity
prevails in mining industries. Under
all these influences the railroads are
prospering too.</p>

<p><b>A Question of Economy.</b>&mdash;A paper,
"Shall we grow the Sugar that we consume?"
by Freeman Stewart, called out
by an article by ex-Secretary Wilson,
besides matter bearing directly on the
question, embodies observations on general
political principles. Thus, it seems
necessary to observe "that the idea that
republicanism requires our public officials
to act as mere weathercocks for
the transient waves of popular clamor
and excitement is also a deplorable delusion,
which, if persistently carried into
effect, will soon utterly destroy republicanism.
As free institutions depend on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the recognition of correct principles by
the people, it is primarily necessary that
correct principles should be constantly
impressed upon the attention of the people.
The great need of the nation to-day
is wise leadership&mdash;unselfish men,
who appreciate the necessity of being
governed by immutable divinely appointed
principles, to act as leaders, to
keep the minds of the people centered
in the right direction." Coming to the
main subject of the essay, we have, as
to the expediency of taxing ourselves
to have sugar made here: "If the farmer's
profits must come from the consumers
of sugar as a bounty or tax, and not
from the inherent profitableness of the
business, then the farmer's profits are
the consumer's loss. The business is inherently
unprofitable, and no farmer, or
any one else, has a right, 'inherent' or
otherwise, to carry on an unprofitable
business, except at his own expense....
It may be assumed that the farmers
who are growing the sugar are now
growing crops which, if not as profitable
as they desire, are at least sufficiently
so to keep them from being burdensome
to the rest of the nation. And how can
the prosperity of the nation be increased
by having these same farmers engage in
a new business which will require them
to draw on the productive capacity of
the rest of the people to the extent of
many millions of dollars annually, in
order to keep their heads above water?"</p>

<p><b>Bacteria of the Dairy.</b>&mdash;An investigation
of the relation of acid fermentation
to the flavor and aroma of butter,
made by C. H. Eckles at the Iowa College
Experiment Station, has given the
results that the flavor is produced by
the bacterial fermentations which have
taken place in the milk and cream.
The kind of flavor depends upon the
class of bacteria causing the fermentation.
The ripening of a good quality of
acid cream is mostly a development of
acid bacteria. Four species of acid-producing
bacteria, tested in ripening pasteurized
cream, were found to give the
butter the typical flavor and aroma. Of
the species tried, the most common
milk-souring organism (<i>Bacterium lactarii</i>)
was found to give the most satisfactory
results in ripening cream. Cream
ripened with common bacteria found in
hay dust (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i>) gives a
very undesirable flavor to butter. The
superior flavor of summer butter is due
to the greater number of bacteria of the
acid class found in milk during that
season.</p>

<p><b>For Outdoor Improvement.</b>&mdash;The
American Park and Outdoor Association
has taken up and aims to nationalize
the important work of the improvement
of outdoors. Not that it expects
to improve upon Nature, but it
hopes to be able to neutralize or remedy
the devastation and disfigurement
which man has wrought upon her face.
At the third annual meeting of the
association, held in Detroit in July,
1899, preliminary steps were taken toward
offering prizes for the improvement
of grounds about manufactories
and homes&mdash;both front and back lots&mdash;and
especially about the homes of artisans.
A standing committee was instituted
to consider the best way of checking
abuses of public advertising. A
paper read by Mr. F. Law Olmstead, on
the Relation of Reservoirs to Public
Parks, concerned such construction of
reservoirs and the surrounding them
with suitable settings as would bring
them into closer harmony with the park
landscape and make them more a part
of it. Another paper, by Mr. R. J.
Coryell, of the Detroit parks, might be
described as an effort to show how a
similar service may be performed for
the parks and the people&mdash;in other
words, how to make the people at home
in the parks. Its points were illustrated
by citing what had been done in
Detroit. Respecting means of preventing
depredations, Mr. C. C. Lancey told
of good results accomplished in Rochester,
N. Y., by the distribution of circulars
of information on the subject; and
Mr. F. L. Olmstead, Jr., of the interest
taken by the children in the school gardens
in Cambridge, Mass.</p>

<p><b>Where Physical Investigation
Fails.</b>&mdash;From the discussion of the
physical method, with its descriptive
laws and applications and hypotheses,
Prof. J. H. Poynting was led, in his
address at the British Association, to
the consideration of the limitation of
its range. It was developed in the
study of matter which we describe as
non-living, and with non-living matter it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
has sufficed for the particular purposes
of the physicist. Of course, only a little
corner of the universe has been explored,
but in the study of non-living
matter we have come to no impassable
gulfs, no chasms across which we can
not throw bridges of hypothesis. Does
the method equally suffice when it is
applied to living matter? Can we give
a purely physical account of such matter?
Do we make any attempt to apply
the physical method to describe and explain
those motions of matter which
on the psychical view we term voluntary?
In practice the strictest physicist
abandons the physical view, and replaces
it by the psychical. He admits
the study of purpose as well as the
study of motion, and has to confess that
here the physical method of prediction
fails.</p>

<p><b>Honors to Sullivant and Lesquereux.</b>&mdash;"Sullivant
day," August 22d,
was devoted in the American Association
to the commemoration of the lives
and works of William S. Sullivant and
C. Leo Lesquereux, botanists, the former
distinguished for his studies in the
mosses and the latter for his researches
in paleobotany, both of whom lived and
did the work by which they became famous
in Columbus, Ohio. Sullivant was
born and passed the whole of his life in
Columbus. Lesquereux, a Swiss by birth,
lived in Columbus during many of his
most fruitful years, and worked alongside
of Sullivant. A considerable number
of objects associated with the two
botanists were on exhibition&mdash;rare botanical
specimens, charts and pictures
connected with their labors, and complete
sets of their published works&mdash;and
excellent and highly prized portraits of
them were shown. The families of both
were represented by the presence of
daughters and granddaughters, among
whom was Miss Arhart, a granddaughter
of Lesquereux, who was associated
with him in part of his work, and made
most of the drawings for his later books.
Prof. C. R. Barnes presided over the
exercises. Prof. W. A. Kellerman read
a tribute to Sullivant from Dr. Gray's
supplement to the Icones. Mrs. Britton
gave a short review of the species
named from Sullivant (including twelve
North American mosses). Professor
Barnes read a tribute to Lesquereux,
taken from the Botanical Gazette. Remarks
were made and papers read on the
Progress in the study of the Hepatica,
by Prof. L. M. Underwood; the Moss
Flora of Alabama, by Dr. Charles Mohr
(read by Professor Earle); the History
of the Study of the Mosses, by Mrs.
Britton; the Classification of Certain
Mosses, by A. J. Grout; the Study of
Lichen Distribution in the Mississippi
Valley, by Bruce Fink; and Botanical
Teaching in the Secondary Schools,
by W. C. Stevens and Ida Clendenin.
Among the exhibits, those of twelve
species of hepatic&aelig; from California, by
Prof. F. E. Lloyd; forty-five photographs
of American students and collectors
made famous by their work in
mosses, by Mrs. Britton and Professor
Underwood; and six species of mosses
discovered and collected originally by
Sullivant and Lesquereux near Columbus,
deserve special mention.</p>

<p><b>Rate of Evolutionary Variation
in the Past.</b>&mdash;Mr. Adam Sedgwick,
speaking, in his address at the British
Association, of variation, selection, and
heredity, having raised the question
whether the variability of organisms
has ever been different from what it is
now, answered it in the affirmative, because
it would be absurd to suppose
that organisms would remain constant
in this respect while they have undergone
alteration in all their other properties.
According to the Darwinian theory
of evolution, one of the most important
factors in determining the modification
of organisms has been natural
selection. It acts by preserving certain
favorable variations, and allowing
others less favorable to be killed off in
the struggle for existence. It will thus
come about that certain variations will
be gradually eliminated, while the variations
of the selected organisms will
themselves be submitted to selection,
and certain of these will in their turn
be eliminated. In this way a group
of organisms becomes more and more
closely adapted to the surroundings.
It would thus appear that the result of
continued selection is to diminish the
variability of a species. Hence, as selection
has been going on all the while,
variation must have been much greater
in past times than it is now. Following
out this train of reasoning, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
driven to the conclusion that one of
the most important results of the evolutionary
change has been the gradual
increase and perfection of heredity as a
function of organisms and a gradual
elimination of variability. This view,
if it can be established, is of the utmost
importance to our theoretical conception
of evolution, because it enables us
to bring our requirements as to time
within the limits granted by the physicists.</p>


<h3>MINOR PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p>Of the arch&aelig;ology of Block Island,
Arthur Hollick found in his explorations
that around the shores of Great Salt
Pond and on the sand dunes that border
the western shores of the island evidences
of former occupation by the Indians
are numerous. Kitchen middens
are exposed in several street cuttings,
implements are often found scattered
over the surface of the ground in certain
localities, and skeletons have been
unearthed from time to time. In many
places the kitchen midden accumulations
were so obvious that it was impossible
to ignore them entirely. They
were found to consist of the customary
collection of oyster and other shells,
bones, pottery fragments, fire-cracked
stones, charcoal, finished implements, rejects,
flakes, chips, etc. The finished implements
found were two axes, of a
plagioclase igneous rock, and three arrow
points, all of quartzite. In the
sand dunes were many old fireplaces,
mostly buried by the sand which has
drifted over them. They could generally
be located by the richness of the turf
on the surface immediately above.
Mixed with the accumulations in these
places were the bones and teeth of animals.
The island promises a good reward
for arch&aelig;ological investigation.</p>

<p>In a form of disease known as peckiness
in the cypress and pin-rot in the
<i>librocedrus</i>, described by Hermann von
Schrenk in a thesis presented to Washington
University, the wood is destroyed
in localized areas, which are surrounded
by apparently sound wood. The cell
walls are changed into compounds,
which diffuse through the walls and fill
the cells surrounding the decayed center,
and these have been called humus
compounds. In both trees a fungus
mycelium occurs, with strongly marked
characteristics, which flourishes within
the diseased centers, and grows between
them without affecting the intervening
wood. This wood can be utilized for
many purposes even when much rotted,
and in neither case does the mycelium
grow after the tree has once been cut
down. The two trees thus diseased,
both representatives of a race of trees
the majority of which are extinct, are
closely related genetically, although
growing in different parts of the country.
The two forms of decay differ but
slightly, and not more than might be
expected in two woods of different character.</p>

<p>Mr. J. C. Arthur, of the Purdue
University Agricultural Experiment Station,
a few years ago picked up a small
white flower (<i>Cerastium arvense oblongifolium</i>)
growing unobtrusively among
the grass and low weeds of the roadside.
It was a little more attractive than its
relative which is called the field chickweed,
and the author suggests the name
of starry grasswort for it. Under cultivation
it spread out over the ground in
a close mat of foliage in a manner characteristic
of many members of the pink
family, to which it belongs; and now for
six weeks in April and May it is a mass
of "dazzling whiteness, softened with
the pale green of stems and leaves,"
while "all winter long the prostrate
stems remain alive to their very tips, and
the leaves maintain a summerlike appearance,"
without the indurated, polished
look so usually associated with
evergreen foliage. This is one roadside
flower taken up, perhaps casually, for
cultivation and improvement. There are
others&mdash;no one knows how many&mdash;that
will doubtless likewise reward the pains
taken with them; and this inspires Mr.
Arthur to suggest to others that they
keep a lookout for plants that may
become desirable garden varieties and
try them. "It is evident that showiness
in the wild state is not the most important
criterion by which to gauge the future
culture value of a plant. One needs
to have many factors in mind to meet
with success, and it is hoped that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
study of the starry grasswort will be
suggestive in this line. The byways and
fields undoubtedly hold many incipiently
valuable decorative plants which
await the discoverer, as truly as do those
of the unexplored regions of Asia and
Africa."</p>

<p>An experiment has been tried in New
York during the past summer in the
way of "vacation schools" for teaching
housekeeping and domestic economy.
Instruction was given daily in these
arts in the public schoolrooms in Front
and Oliver Streets and in Hester Street.
At Front and Oliver Streets girls were
taught to air, clean, and take care of
a bedroom; to set table, clean, and take
care of a living room; kitchen cleanliness;
laundry work&mdash;one week being devoted
to each course, and talks were
given on furnishing a flat, the care of
a cellar, and the importance of air and
sunlight to health. The children were
also taught daily to cook appetizing
dishes and serve them. At Hester Street
more time was given to the cooking lessons,
instruction was given on the feeding
of babies, and a class in nursing
was taught; among other things, emergency
bandaging, caring for helpless patients,
and the hygiene of the sick-room.</p>

<p>Mr. A. P. Coleman, during some
geological work last summer on the
north shore of Lake Superior, about
Heron Bay, discovered a new mineral,
which he has named <i>Heronite</i>, and which
he describes at length in the Journal of
Geology for July-August. It is a dike
rock, consisting essentially of analcite,
orthoclase, plagioclase, and &aelig;gyrite, the
analcite having the character of a base,
in which the other minerals form radiating
groups of crystals. The analcite
clearly represents the magma left after
the crystallization of the imbedded minerals,
and it is evident that it can be
formed only from a magma highly
charged with water, and therefore under
pressure.</p>

<p>From the examination of a number
of nearly pure hydrocarbons obtained
from American petroleum by Young, it
appears that the same classes of hydrocarbons,
paraffins, polymethylene compounds
of naphthenes and aromatic hydrocarbons
are present in these and in
Russian and Galician petroleums; but
that Russian petroleum contains a relatively
larger amount of naphthalenes
and, in all probability, of aromatic hydrocarbons,
than Galician, and Galician
a larger amount of the same hydrocarbons
than American petroleum.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>An old contributor, Dr. A. F. A. King,
of Washington, D. C., writes us calling
attention to the interesting fact that
we printed an article of his as far back
as September, 1883, suggesting the mosquito
theory of malaria, and giving a
number of observations which seemed
strongly to support this view.</p>

<p>Experiments made by F. H. Hall
and W. P. Wheeler, at the New York
Agricultural Experiment Station, regarding
the best food for "chicks, pullets,
cockerels, and ducklings," seem to
indicate conclusively that part of the
protein must be drawn from animal
sources if we are to get the best results.
Rations in which from forty to fifty per
cent of the protein was supplied by animal
food produced more rapid growth
and at less cost of production.</p>

<p>Messrs. A. Stutzer and Hartlieb,
of Breslau, have detected bacteria
in Portland cements, which provoke the
liberation of the nitrogen from nitrogenous
compounds in water, and the formation
of nitrous and nitric acids that
act upon the lime in the cement and
promote its disintegration.</p>

<p>According to Industries and Iron,
the tides are now utilized for generating
power at Pont-l'Abb&eacute;, Finisterre,
France, during fourteen hours per day.
At flood tide the water flows through a
canal two miles and a half inland into
a pond in the rear of the power house,
and returns to the sea at ebb tide. The
total fall is seven feet and a half, and
eighty-horse power is generated by
means of turbines. Means have been
considered for applying this method of
generating power to various industries.</p>

<p>A proposal for an International
Physical Congress has been accepted by
the authorities of the Paris Exposition
of 1900, and the congress will be held
from the 6th to the 12th of August,
under the auspices of the French Government.
It immediately precedes the
International Electrical Congress. So
far as has yet been determined, the subjects
of the addresses and reports will
be classified under the headings of the
definition and fixing certain units (of
pressure, scale of hardness, quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
heat, etc.), the Bibliography of Physics,
and National Laboratories. The final
programme is, however, still to be settled.
The subscription for membership
is twenty francs, or four dollars. The
foreign secretary of the congress is M.
Charles Edouard Guillaume, Pavillon de
Breteuil, Sevres (Seine et Oise), Paris.</p>

<p>In a book called Literary Munich Portraits,
with brief biographical sketches
by Paul Heyse, are given of twenty-five
of the most prominent literary men of
that brilliant capital. Only two authors
not Germans are included. One of them
is our contributor, E. P. Evans. The
other is the Norwegian novelist Bj&ouml;rnson.
Heyse leaves himself out, although
he is the greatest literary character of
them all.</p>

<p>Some recent experiments, conducted
jointly by the Kew Observatory Committee
and the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures at S&egrave;vres, were
made to compare the platinum thermometer
of Professor Callendar, which
measures temperature by the varying resistance
of a platinum wire, and the
older mercury and gas thermometers.
It was found that below 100&deg; C. the differences
between the observed values on
the nitrogen scale and those deduced
from the platinum thermometer are exceedingly
small, and that even at the
highest temperature (590&deg;) the differences
only amount to a few tenths of a
degree.</p>

<p>The American Chemical Society has
gained 232 members during the past year,
making the present number 1,540. The
report of the committee on the analysis
of coal, submitted to the recent meeting
of the society at Columbus, Ohio, embodied
detailed instructions in regard
to the best methods of analyzing coke,
and outlined a plan for securing uniformity
in such analysis by chemists
throughout the land. This report was
adopted.</p>

<p>At the recent annual meeting of the
American Society for the Promotion of
Agricultural Science Prof. W. J. Beal
reported concerning the germination of
seeds, after long keeping, that experiments
had been tried with various seeds
five, ten, fifteen, and twenty years old,
from which it appeared that seeds of a
large number of important plants would
germinate after fifteen years, but the
number sprouting after twenty years
was small.</p>

<p>A paper was read by Dr. L. O. Howard,
at the recent meeting of the American
Society of Entomologists, recording
the success which has been obtained by
the fig-raisers of California in fertilizing
the Smyrna variety of figs by the
aid of the blastophaga which issues from
the Capri figs covered with their pollen.
A generation of the blastophaga has been
developed at Fresno by which many
Smyrna figs have been satisfactorily fertilized,
and there is considerable probability

<p>The five hundredth anniversary of
the birth of Gutenberg, associated with
the invention of printing, is to be celebrated
at Mayence, June 24, 1900. It
is hoped that the foundation of a Gutenberg
Museum may be a result of this
movement. An exhibition illustrating
the art and progress of printing is also
expected to be held.</p>

<p>The conclusion is drawn by the Italian,
Signor Albini, from investigations
on the nutritive value of whole-meal
bread, that it is inferior to that of ordinary
white bread, and that a further
disadvantage comes from the excessive
quantity of indigestible matter, formed
of the harder parts of the pericarp of the
grain, which it contains.</p>

Key to the Stars "and all of the inspired writings shall be free&mdash;i. e., free from the love of
the lust of gain and that the charging of three dollars for Science and Health, etc., when it
can be printed and sold for less than fifty cents per copy, is wrong in principle, and, in
effect, shuts the doors of this beautiful truth upon the poor by thus putting a prohibitive
price upon it....
</p>
<p>
"We hold that in the giving of class instruction the teacher is entitled to a reasonable
compensation, and give our opinion that such compensation should be ten dollars, and we
do condemn the present practice when they charge one hundred dollars for a series of
twelve lessons. Take a class of thirty&mdash;which is not unusual&mdash;the teacher receives about
$258 per day for two hours' work. This is unjust, and especially so, because many of these
teachers are unable and unfit for teaching.
</p>
<p>
"In the matter of healing, when the healer gives the proper time to the work, one dollar
per treatment ought not to be excessive, but the practice of some of charging before the
patient is received into the room and then heavily charged for the treatment, is an outrage,
... and should be prohibited."&mdash;<i>See full text, Washington News Letter, September 6, 1899;

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The highest education consists in the presentation and in the acceptance of the purest
ideas and the highest ideals of all ages, whether they be presented in written or spoken
words, in songs of voices or sounds of instruments, in plastic forms or glowing pictures, in
humble lives or glorious actions. The well-educated man should be the product and the
epitome of the best thoughts and sentiments the world has produced, for he carries the
responsibility of past centuries.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> There is a bust of Julius C&aelig;sar in England of which a cast or a copy should be by
the side of every expounder of the Commentaries. The presence of the bust would give
new life to the narrative, for there is more life in the marble than in the writing.
There are in the Louvre, placed side by side, three representations of Nero which tell
the story of the man more graphically than the pages of Suetonius. The first represents
the youth, whose thoughts are pure, hopes bright, and resolves noble. The second shows
the conflict with evil and the beginning of the triumph of sin. The third is so monstrous
in its brutality and lust that it must have been taken but a short time before the catastrophe
which terminated the matricide's career. Historians may detail the circumstances of
the fall of Rome, philosophers may investigate the causes which led to it, but that hideous
face in the Louvre tells the whole story with a force so startling, so instantaneous, that history
and philosophy seem weak and wanting.</p></div>

Board of Agriculture in 1893, said: "At the best, the Indian <i>raiyat</i>, or cultivator, is
quite as good as, and in some respects the superior of, the average British farmer. It is
wonderful, too, how much is known of rotation, the system of mixed crops, and of fallowing.
Certain it is that I, at least, have never seen a more perfect picture of careful cultivation,
combined with hard labor, perseverance, and fertility of resource, than I have seen
at many of the halting places. Such are the gardens of M&aacute;him, the fields of Nadiad, the
center of the garden of Gujarat, in Bombay."</p></div>
